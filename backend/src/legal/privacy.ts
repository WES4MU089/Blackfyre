Last Updated: February 22, 2026

Dragon's Dominion ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information when you use the Dragon's Dominion client application and associated services ("Service").

1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We collect only the information necessary to provide and operate the Service:

a) Discord Account Data: When you authenticate via Discord OAuth, we receive and store your Discord user ID and username. This information is used solely for account identification and authentication. We do not request or store your Discord email address.

b) Second Life Avatar Data: If you link your Second Life account, we store your avatar UUID and display name to enable in-game integration between the HUD overlay and the Second Life environment. While the HUD client and the in-world sync object are both active, we also receive and process your avatar's current region name and position coordinates for gameplay purposes such as location-based mechanics and proximity detection. This data is transmitted in real time and is not permanently stored.

c) Character and Game Data: Information you provide while using the Service, including character names, backstories, aptitude selections, inventory states, and other game-related data that you create or modify during gameplay.

d) Chat Logs: All in-character (IC) and out-of-character (OOC) chat messages sent through the Service are logged and stored on our servers. Chat logs are retained for the purpose of moderation, dispute resolution, and community safety. Authorized administrators and staff members may review chat logs when investigating reported issues.

e) Authentication Tokens: We issue JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management. These tokens are stored locally on your device and are used to authenticate your requests to our server.

2. INFORMATION WE DO NOT COLLECT

We want to be clear about what we do NOT collect:

a) We do NOT collect any data from your computer or device beyond what is described in Section 1. The client application does not scan, access, read, or transmit any files, folders, applications, system information, hardware identifiers, or other data from your machine.

b) We do NOT use analytics services, tracking pixels, advertising identifiers, or any form of behavioral tracking.

c) We do NOT use cookies. The client application is a standalone desktop application that does not use browser cookies.

d) We do NOT collect browsing history, search history, or information about other applications on your device.

e) We do NOT collect hardware specifications, operating system details, or device fingerprints.

f) The client application communicates exclusively with our game server. Our server also receives HTTP requests from in-world Second Life scripts to enable gameplay integration. Neither the client nor the server contacts any third-party advertising networks, analytics services, or data brokers.

3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

a) Authentication and Account Management: To verify your identity, manage your account, and maintain session security.

b) Game Functionality: To provide core game features including character management, inventory tracking, combat mechanics, and all other gameplay systems.

c) Communication: To deliver in-game chat messages, notifications, and system announcements.

d) Moderation and Safety: To investigate reported violations, resolve disputes between players, enforce our Terms of Service, and maintain a safe community environment. This includes the review of chat logs by authorized staff.

e) Service Maintenance: To diagnose technical issues, fix bugs, and improve the reliability and performance of the Service.

4. DATA SHARING

a) We do NOT sell, rent, lease, or trade your personal information to any third party.

b) We do NOT share your data with advertising networks, data brokers, or analytics providers.

c) We may disclose information if required by law, legal process, or governmental request, or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety, or the safety of others.

5. DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY

a) All data is stored on our servers. We employ standard security practices including encrypted connections, secure authentication, and access controls to protect your information.

b) Access to player data and chat logs is restricted to authorized administrators and staff members who need it for moderation and service operation.

c) While we take reasonable measures to protect your data, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

6. DATA RETENTION

a) Account data (Discord ID, username) is retained for as long as your account remains active.

b) Character and game data is retained for as long as your account remains active.

c) Chat logs are retained for moderation purposes. We may retain chat logs for a reasonable period after account closure to address any pending or potential moderation matters.

7. YOUR RIGHTS

a) Access: You may request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.

b) Deletion: You may request the deletion of your account and all associated data. Upon account deletion, we will remove your personal data, character data, and game data. Note that certain data (such as chat logs involving other users) may be retained in anonymized form for moderation integrity.

c) Correction: You may request correction of inaccurate personal data.

d) To exercise any of these rights, please contact us through our official Discord server or the communication channels provided within the Service. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

8. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

The Service is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 18, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.

9. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

a) We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date and requiring re-acceptance through the client application.

b) Your continued use of the Service after accepting an updated Privacy Policy constitutes your acknowledgment and agreement to the revised policy.
