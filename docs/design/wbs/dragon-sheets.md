# Dragon Sheets — The Dance of the Dragons

> Quick-reference stat blocks for every dragon in the Dance era. For full system rules (combat resolution, WBS integration, temperament), see [dragon-system.md](dragon-system.md).

> **STAFF ONLY:** This document contains **Favored Aptitudes** — these are hidden from players. Players do not know which aptitude a dragon favors. Discovery happens through roleplay, lore research, and deduction. Do NOT share Favored Aptitude information with players. The public-facing version of dragon sheets should omit the Favored Aptitude row entirely.

| **Terror** | (Tier × 2) + floor(Ferocity / 2) |

---

## Tier Overview

| Tier | Description | Stat Total | HP Range |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T5 — Apex** | The deadliest dragons alive. Each one can turn a war. | 28-37 | 300-500 |

| **T2 — Blooded** | Young or untested. **Not rideable or combat-capable.** Auto-grows to T3 after 90 days. No named dragons at this tier (all bumped to T3). | 12-18 | 60-120 |
| **T1 — Fledgling** | Very young, fragile. **Not rideable or combat-capable.** Auto-grows to T2 after 90 days. No named dragons at this tier (all bumped to T3). | 6-12 | 20-50 |

---

## T5 — Apex

### Vhagar — *The Queen of All Dragons*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Greens |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded |
| **Size** | Ancient (~180 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Command** — respects authority and the bearing of a war leader |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **10** | Jaws that can swallow a horse. Fire that melts stone. |
| Agility | **3** | Slow to turn. Massive wingbeats. Fights like a battering ram. |
| Ferocity | **10** | A veteran of Aegon's Conquest. Will never stop fighting. |
| Resilience | **10** | Scales like castle walls. Nothing short of another dragon threatens her. |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **500** | (10+10) × 5 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **20** | 10 + 10 |
| **Evasion** | **8** | 3 + 5 |
| **Terror** | **15** | 5×2 + 10/2 |

> Vhagar is the ultimate tank — the highest HP in the game, the highest Might, and functionally immune to scorpion bolts. Her Ferocity 10 means she will never retreat, never disengage — she fights until one of them is dead. Her weakness is Agility 3: she cannot dodge, cannot disengage from faster dragons, and strikes second against almost everyone.

---

### Caraxes — *The Blood Wyrm*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Blacks |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded |
| **Size** | Elder (~80 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Prowess** — responds to raw combat presence, a warrior's spirit |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **7** | Not the biggest, but powerful jaws and searing fire |
| Agility | **9** | The most maneuverable war dragon alive. Twists like a serpent in the air. |
| Ferocity | **10** | Will not stop. Will not retreat. Will ride you into the lake and die with his teeth in your throat. |
| Resilience | **6** | Lean build means less bulk to absorb hits. His defense is not getting hit. |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **325** | (7+6) × 5 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **17** | 7 + 10 |
| **Evasion** | **12** | 9 + 3 |
| **Terror** | **15** | 5×2 + 10/2 |

> Caraxes is the opposite of Vhagar — low HP for a T5, but the highest base Evasion among T5s and Ferocity 10. He wins by dodging what others can't dodge and never, ever stopping. His Terror of 15 is the highest of any dragon, tied with the Cannibal.

---

### Meleys — *The Red Queen*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Blacks |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded |
| **Size** | Elder (~70 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Presence** — responds to force of personality and gravity |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **7** | Powerful for her size |
| Agility | **10** | The swiftest dragon in Westeros — none can match her in the air |
| Ferocity | **8** | A fighter — battle-tested and dangerous |
| Resilience | **7** | Solid, battle-tested |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **350** | (7+7) × 5 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **15** | 7 + 8 |
| **Evasion** | **13** | 10 + 3 |
| **Terror** | **14** | 5×2 + 8/2 |

> Meleys is the swiftest dragon alive — her Agility 10 gives her the highest Evasion (13) of any dragon. She compensates for lower Might and Resilience with sheer speed. At Rook's Rest, she nearly killed both Sunfyre and Vhagar before being overwhelmed by numbers.

---

### Vermithor — *The Bronze Fury*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Unbonded |
| **Bond Status** | Unbonded (last rider: King Jaehaerys I) |
| **Size** | Elder (~100 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Command** — expects a ruler's bearing, decisive and unyielding |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **9** | Enormous. Nearly Vhagar's equal in raw power. |
| Agility | **5** | Large but not sluggish — better than Vhagar in the air |
| Ferocity | **7** | A war dragon, battle-tested, but calmer than Caraxes |
| Resilience | **9** | Thick bronze scales. Nearly impervious. |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **450** | (9+9) × 5 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **16** | 9 + 7 (no rider) |
| **Evasion** | **9** | 5 + 4 (no rider) |
| **Terror** | **13** | 5×2 + 7/2 |

> Vermithor is the second-most durable dragon alive after Vhagar, and arguably more dangerous in a fight — he trades 50 HP and 1 Might for 2 more Agility. If someone claims him, the balance of the Dance shifts overnight.

---

### The Cannibal

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Wild |
| **Bond Status** | Wild (never bonded) |
| **Size** | Elder? (unknown age — possibly ancient) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Fortitude** — respects only survival; endure his presence or die |
| **Bonding DC** | **10** (base 8 + 2 never-bonded) |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **8** | Massive, fed on other dragons |
| Agility | **6** | Surprisingly agile for his bulk |
| Ferocity | **10** | Eats other dragons. Eats dragon eggs. Pure killing instinct. |
| Resilience | **8** | Scarred, thick-scaled, survived centuries wild |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **400** | (8+8) × 5 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **18** | 8 + 10 (no rider) |
| **Evasion** | **10** | 6 + 4 (no rider) |
| **Terror** | **15** | 5×2 + 10/2 |

> The Cannibal is arguably the most dangerous dragon in a fight — Strike 18 (tied with Vhagar's base), Evasion 10, and Ferocity 10 means he hits like Vhagar, dodges better than Vhagar, and will never stop fighting. His weakness is that he has never been ridden and probably never will be.

---

## T4 — Formidable

### Dreamfyre — *The Old She-Dragon*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Greens |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded |
| **Size** | Elder (~90 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Faith** — gentle and spiritual, responds to inner sight |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **7** | Large and powerful |
| Agility | **4** | Aging, not built for aerial combat |
| Ferocity | **5** | Not a fighter by inclination |
| Resilience | **8** | Thick old scales |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **300** | (7+8) × 4 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **12** | 7 + 5 |
| **Evasion** | **8** | 4 + 4 |
| **Terror** | **10** | 4×2 + 5/2 |

> Dreamfyre has the body of a T5 — physically massive and ancient enough. But she has never been pushed and never fought. In the right hands, she could be devastating.

---

### Silverwing

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Unbonded |
| **Bond Status** | Unbonded (last rider: Queen Alysanne) |
| **Size** | Elder (~80 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Presence** — responds to warmth and genuine charisma |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **7** | Powerful enough |
| Agility | **5** | Average |
| Ferocity | **4** | Not a natural fighter. Gentle by dragon standards. |
| Resilience | **8** | Old, thick scales |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **300** | (7+8) × 4 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **11** | 7 + 4 (no rider) |
| **Evasion** | **9** | 5 + 4 (no rider) |
| **Terror** | **10** | 4×2 + 4/2 |

> Silverwing is Dreamfyre's near-twin statistically — similar size, similar age, similar temperament. Both are T4 because they have the physical power of apex dragons without the killer instinct. Silverwing is the most likely unbonded dragon to accept a new rider.

---

## T3 — War-Capable

### Sunfyre — *The Most Beautiful Dragon*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Greens |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded |
| **Size** | Adult (~30 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Presence** — responds to regal bearing and devotion |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **6** | Solid but not exceptional |
| Agility | **6** | Average maneuverability |
| Ferocity | **7** | Extraordinary tenacity — will fight through crippling injuries |
| Resilience | **6** | Average toughness, but his will compensates |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **240** | (6+6) × 4 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **13** | 6 + 7 |
| **Evasion** | **9** | 6 + 3 |
| **Terror** | **11** | 4×2 + 7/2 |

> Sunfyre earns T4 through sheer tenacity. His raw stats are unremarkable, but Ferocity 7 reflects extraordinary determination: crippled at Rook's Rest, dragged across the realm, and he still killed Moondancer. At T4, his 240 HP makes him a genuine threat rather than a glass cannon.

---

### Seasmoke

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Blacks |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded |
| **Size** | Adult (~40 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Prowess** — respects fighters and martial grit |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **5** | Solid, not exceptional |
| Agility | **7** | Quick and responsive |
| Ferocity | **6** | A reliable fighter |
| Resilience | **5** | Average |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **150** | (5+5) × 3 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **11** | 5 + 6 |
| **Evasion** | **9** | 7 + 2 |
| **Terror** | **9** | 3×2 + 6/2 |

> Seasmoke is the prototypical T3 — a solid, reliable war dragon without any standout traits. His value is consistency and his willingness to accept new riders.

---

### Sheepstealer

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Wild (later claimed by Nettles) |
| **Bond Status** | Wild, later bonded |
| **Size** | Adult (~60 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Cunning** — respects cleverness, patience, and understanding |
| **Bonding DC** | **6** (base 5 + 1 wild) |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **5** | Not large, not powerful |
| Agility | **8** | Quick, evasive, a survivor |
| Ferocity | **6** | Will fight if cornered but prefers to flee |
| Resilience | **5** | Average |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **150** | (5+5) × 3 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **11** | 5 + 6 (no rider) |
| **Evasion** | **10** | 8 + 2 (no rider) |
| **Terror** | **9** | 3×2 + 6/2 |

> Sheepstealer's Agility 8 makes him the hardest T3 to hit — his survival strategy is evasion, not endurance. In a straight fight he is average, but he is nearly impossible to catch if he wants to run.

---

### Grey Ghost

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Wild |
| **Bond Status** | Wild (never bonded) |
| **Size** | Adult (~50 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Cunning** — the most elusive dragon; must outwit, not overpower |
| **Bonding DC** | **6** (base 5 + 1 wild) |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **5** | Average |
| Agility | **9** | The most elusive dragon alive — almost never seen |
| Ferocity | **2** | Avoids all conflict. Flees rather than fights. |
| Resilience | **5** | Average |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **150** | (5+5) × 3 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **7** | 5 + 2 (no rider) |
| **Evasion** | **11** | 9 + 2 (no rider) |
| **Terror** | **7** | 3×2 + 2/2 |

> Grey Ghost is a paradox — T3 in physical capability, but Ferocity 2 means he will almost never fight. His Evasion 11 is the highest of any non-T5 dragon, making him nearly impossible to catch. He is T3 because of his body, not his will.

---

## T3 — War-Capable (Bumped from T2/T1)

*The following dragons were originally T2 or T1 but have been bumped to T3 minimum — T1/T2 dragons are not rideable or combat-capable. Their raw stats are unchanged; only the Tier multiplier in HP and Terror formulas has been recalculated.*

### Tessarion — *The Blue Queen*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Greens |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded |
| **Size** | Adolescent (~15 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Command** — responds to confidence and steady authority |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **4** | Young, still growing |
| Agility | **7** | Quick and nimble for her size |
| Ferocity | **5** | Untested in true dragon combat |
| Resilience | **4** | Young scales — vulnerable |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **120** | (4+4) × 3 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **9** | 4 + 5 |
| **Evasion** | **9** | 7 + 2 |
| **Terror** | **8** | 3×2 + 5/2 |

> Tessarion is a low-end T3 with balanced stats for her age. Good Agility and decent Strike make her competitive against other T3s, but her low Might and Resilience leave her physically vulnerable.

---

### Syrax — *The Golden Dragon*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Blacks |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded |
| **Size** | Adult (~30 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Stewardship** — responds to comfort, routine, and caretaking |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **6** | Large enough but never pushed |
| Agility | **5** | Sluggish — fed, not exercised |
| Ferocity | **3** | Never tested. Pampered. Does not know how to fight. |
| Resilience | **6** | Adequate bulk, untested scales |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **180** | (6+6) × 3 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **9** | 6 + 3 |
| **Evasion** | **8** | 5 + 3 |
| **Terror** | **7** | 3×2 + 3/2 |

> Syrax is the poster child for "combat power, not size." Physically she is an Adult — larger than Tessarion, larger than Vermax. But she has never fought, never hunted, never been pushed. Her high HP (180) comes from bulk, not combat hardening. She is a low-end T3 with deceptive durability but poor offensive instincts.

---

### Vermax

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Blacks |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded |
| **Size** | Adolescent (~16 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Prowess** — responds to martial energy and willingness to fight |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **4** | Not yet fully grown |
| Agility | **7** | Quick and responsive |
| Ferocity | **6** | Willing to fight |
| Resilience | **4** | Young scales |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **120** | (4+4) × 3 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **10** | 4 + 6 |
| **Evasion** | **9** | 7 + 2 |
| **Terror** | **9** | 3×2 + 6/2 |

> Vermax is the best pure fighter among the bumped T3s — Ferocity 6 and Strike 10 give him real offensive output. He and Tessarion are well-matched rivals at the low end of T3.

---

### Moondancer

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Blacks |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded |
| **Size** | Young (~12 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Fortitude** — respects endurance and the refusal to back down |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **3** | Small, still growing |
| Agility | **8** | Extremely nimble — one of the fastest young dragons |
| Ferocity | **7** | Fierce beyond her size. |
| Resilience | **3** | Fragile. Young scales offer little protection. |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **90** | (3+3) × 3 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **10** | 3 + 7 |
| **Evasion** | **9** | 8 + 1 |
| **Terror** | **9** | 3×2 + 7/2 |

> Moondancer is dangerously brave for her size. Agility 8 and Ferocity 7 give her the combat instincts of a much larger dragon, but Might 3 and Resilience 3 mean she cannot take a hit. The lowest HP among T3s (90) — a glass cannon who will either kill you fast or die fast.

---

### Arrax

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Blacks |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded |
| **Size** | Young (~14 years, small for his age) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Presence** — small and fearful, needs reassurance |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **2** | Barely more than a hatchling in combat terms |
| Agility | **7** | Fast for his size — his only advantage |
| Ferocity | **4** | Snapped at Vhagar out of fear, not courage |
| Resilience | **2** | Fragile. One bite from Vhagar ended him. |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **60** | (2+2) × 3 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **6** | 2 + 4 |
| **Evasion** | **8** | 7 + 1 |
| **Terror** | **8** | 3×2 + 4/2 |

> Arrax is the weakest T3 by raw stats — Might 2 and Resilience 2 make him physically fragile even with the tier bump to 60 HP. His Agility 7 is his lifeline. Against Vhagar, the disengagement math would still favor him — but one hit from a T5 deals more than his entire HP pool.

---

### Tyraxes

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Blacks |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded |
| **Size** | Young (~10 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Stewardship** — timid and young, responds to patient caretaking |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **2** | Small and underdeveloped |
| Agility | **5** | Average for a young dragon |
| Ferocity | **3** | Timid. Does not want to fight. |
| Resilience | **2** | Fragile |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **60** | (2+2) × 3 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **5** | 2 + 3 |
| **Evasion** | **6** | 5 + 1 |
| **Terror** | **7** | 3×2 + 3/2 |

> Tyraxes is the weakest combat dragon on the roster. Low stats across the board and a temperament that makes him unlikely to fight even if commanded. The tier bump gives him survivable HP (60) but he remains a reluctant combatant at best.

---

### Stormcloud

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | Blacks |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded |
| **Size** | Young (~8 years) |
| **Favored Aptitude** | **Fortitude** — the bravest T1, responds to courage and endurance |

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Might | **2** | Small |
| Agility | **6** | Decent reflexes |
| Ferocity | **6** | Brave beyond his size. Fought to save his rider despite being badly wounded. |
| Resilience | **2** | Fragile |

| Derived | Value | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| **HP** | **60** | (2+2) × 3 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **8** | 2 + 6 |
| **Evasion** | **7** | 6 + 1 |
| **Terror** | **9** | 3×2 + 6/2 |

> Stormcloud is the best fighter among the originally-fledgling dragons — Ferocity 6 and Strike 8 give him genuine offensive capability. He carried Aegon III across the Gullet through enemy dragonfire, taking mortal wounds and still flying until he reached safety. He died of his wounds. The bravest dragon on the roster, regardless of tier.

---

### Morning

| | |
|---|---|
| **Faction** | — |
| **Bond Status** | Not yet hatched at start of Dance |
| **Size** | Egg/Hatchling |

Stats TBD when/if hatched and grown. Likely T1 initially.
