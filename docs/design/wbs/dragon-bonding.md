# Dragon Bonding System

*How a Dragonseed claims a dragon — or dies trying.*

---

## 1. Design Pillars

### The Bond Is Sacred

A dragon bonds with one rider for life. The bond cannot be transferred, broken by force, or shared. When the rider dies, the dragon becomes unbonded and may — eventually — accept another. But the bond itself is a singular, irreversible event. You do not tame a dragon. You do not own a dragon. The dragon *chooses* you, or it does not.

### Blood Is the Price of Entry

Only those with the blood of Old Valyria — Targaryens, Velaryons, and the bastard-born Dragonseeds — can bond with a dragon. This is not a social convention. It is a biological fact. The blood sings to the dragon, and without it, there is no song. A non-Dragonseed who approaches a dragon is meat.

### One Chance. One Dragon.

A bonding attempt is a singular event. You approach the dragon, and either it accepts you or it does not. There are no second chances with the same dragon. If Vermithor rejects you, he will always reject you. You may try a different dragon — but you carry the mark of that failure with you.

### Preparation Is Everything

The difference between a successful bonding and a funeral pyre is preparation. The right rituals, the right sacrifices, the right allies standing behind you. A Dragonseed who walks up to a T5 dragon with nothing but courage will die. A Dragonseed who spends weeks preparing, who brings a Red Priest and a Maester and offers their own blood — that Dragonseed might live.

### The Dragon Chooses

Every dragon is different. Vhagar respects authority. Caraxes respects violence. Sheepstealer respects cleverness. The system encodes this through **Favored Aptitudes** — each dragon responds to a different quality in its potential rider. A master spy with Cunning 9 is wasted on Vermithor but perfect for Sheepstealer. Knowing which dragon to approach is as important as the approach itself.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Four hard gates must be satisfied before a bonding attempt can occur:

### 2.1 Dragonseed Blood

The character must have `is_dragon_seed = true` or be a member of a Targaryen/Velaryon house. Characters without Valyrian blood cannot bond with dragons under any circumstances. No amount of ritual, sacrifice, or preparation can substitute for the blood.

### 2.2 Unbonded Dragon

The dragon must not currently have a living rider. Bonded dragons reject all others — this is not a roll, it is an absolute. If the rider is alive, the dragon is unavailable.

### 2.3 Staff Approval

Staff must approve the bonding attempt based on the character's RP leadup. This includes:
- How did the character learn about the dragon?
- How did they approach it (physically — did they travel to Dragonstone, the Dragonpit, etc.)?
- What in-character preparation did they do?
- Is this consistent with the character's story and motivations?

Staff approval is a narrative gate, not a mechanical one. Staff cannot modify the roll or the DC — they can only approve or deny the attempt itself.

### 2.4 One Attempt Per Dragon

A character may only attempt to bond with each dragon once in their lifetime. A failure (of any kind) permanently closes that dragon to that character. The character may attempt a different dragon in the future, but never the same one.

---

## 3. The Bonding Roll

### 3.1 Dice System

The bonding roll uses the standard d6 dice pool system. Roll a number of d6s equal to your **Bonding Pool**. Each die that shows **4 or higher** is one success (50% per die). Compare total successes against the dragon's **Difficulty Class**.

### 3.2 Bonding Pool Construction

**Pool = Favored Aptitude + Lore Assistance + Faith Assistance + Sacrifice Bonus + Group Assistance**

| Source | Dice Added | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Favored Aptitude** | 1-10 | The bonder's score in the dragon's favored aptitude |
| **Lore Assistance** | 0-2 | An **assisting player** with high Lore performs the ritual. Lore check (d6, 4+) from the assistant — not the bonder. Bonus = floor(assistant's Lore / 5) |
| **Faith Assistance** | 0-3 | An **assisting player** with high Faith performs an invocation. Faith check (d6, 4+) from the assistant — not the bonder. Bonus = floor(assistant's Faith / 5). R'hllor: +1 additional |
| **Personal Sacrifice** | 0-4 | See Section 5. Cap of +4 regardless of combination. |
| **Group Assistance** | 0-4 | Up to 4 assistants, each contributing +1 on a successful assist roll |

**Important:** Lore and Faith bonuses come from **assisting players**, not from the bonder themselves — unless the favored aptitude happens to be Lore or Faith (in which case the bonder's own score already contributes via the Favored Aptitude row). The bonder's personal Lore or Faith score does not add bonus dice.

**Maximum theoretical pool: ~23d6.** A realistic well-prepared attempt: 10-14d6.

**Note on Favored Aptitudes:** Each dragon's favored aptitude is a **hidden mechanic** — players do not know which aptitude a dragon favors. Discovery happens through roleplay, lore research, and trial. The favored aptitudes listed in §3.3 below are for staff reference only and must not be shared with players.

### 3.3 Favored Aptitudes

Each dragon has a single favored aptitude that reflects what quality it respects, fears, or responds to in a potential rider. This is the primary aptitude the bonder rolls.

#### T5 — Apex

| Dragon | Favored Aptitude | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Vhagar** | **Command** | The queen of war dragons has served conquerors and kings. She flew with Visenya during the Conquest. She respects authority — the bearing of someone born to lead armies and rule. |
| **Caraxes** | **Prowess** | The Blood Wyrm is violence incarnate. He mirrors his rider's ferocity. Daemon was the finest warrior of his age, and Caraxes chose him. He responds to raw combat presence — a warrior's spirit, not a politician's words. |
| **Meleys** | **Presence** | The Red Queen chose Rhaenys — the Queen Who Never Was. A woman of gravity, political acumen, and unshakeable composure. Meleys responds to force of personality, to someone who commands a room without raising their voice. |
| **Vermithor** | **Command** | The Bronze Fury served the greatest Targaryen king. Jaehaerys was not just a ruler — he was *the* ruler. Vermithor expects a king's bearing: decisive, commanding, unyielding. Half-measures will not do. |
| **The Cannibal** | **Fortitude** | The oldest wild dragon has never been bonded. He eats other dragons. He eats dragon eggs. He is pure survival instinct, and he respects nothing but the same. Only someone who can endure his presence — the heat, the terror, the primal wrongness of standing before a creature that kills its own kind — without flinching has any chance at all. |

#### T4 — Formidable

| Dragon | Favored Aptitude | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Dreamfyre** | **Faith** | The old she-dragon is gentle and introspective. Her rider Helaena is a dreamer — she sees visions, speaks in riddles. Dreamfyre responds to spiritual depth, to someone who understands the world beyond the physical. |
| **Silverwing** | **Presence** | Queen Alysanne's dragon. Alysanne was the most beloved queen in Targaryen history — kind, warm, and charming in a way that made people want to follow her. Silverwing responds to that same warmth. Not command, not aggression. Genuine charisma. |

#### T3 — War-Capable

| Dragon | Favored Aptitude | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Sunfyre** | **Presence** | The most beautiful dragon alive, bonded to a king. Aegon II's love for Sunfyre was legendary — and Sunfyre's loyalty to Aegon was equally fierce. Sunfyre responds to devotion and regal bearing. |
| **Seasmoke** | **Prowess** | A straightforward war dragon. Seasmoke accepted Addam of Hull — a bastard sailor with no name, no title, and no political standing. What Addam had was grit. Seasmoke respects fighters. |
| **Sheepstealer** | **Cunning** | The survivor of Dragonstone. Nettles didn't fight him, didn't intimidate him, didn't pray over him. She brought him sheep. Every day. Until he let her climb on. Sheepstealer respects cleverness, patience, and understanding what a creature actually wants. |
| **Grey Ghost** | **Cunning** | The most elusive dragon alive — Ferocity 2, Agility 9. Grey Ghost avoids everything and everyone. To even *find* him requires cunning. To approach without scaring him away requires more. This is not a dragon you overpower. This is a dragon you outwit. |

#### T3 — War-Capable (Bumped from T2/T1)

*These dragons were originally T2 or T1 but have been bumped to T3 minimum (T1/T2 are not rideable or combat-capable). Their favored aptitudes and bonding DCs are unchanged — bonding difficulty is based on the dragon's personality, not combat tier.*

| Dragon | Favored Aptitude | Why | Originally |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tessarion** | **Command** | The Blue Queen, bonded to Prince Daeron — a natural leader praised for his composure under pressure. Tessarion responds to confidence and steady authority. | T2 |
| **Syrax** | **Stewardship** | Pampered, well-fed, and never pushed. Syrax has lived a life of comfort. She responds to caretaking — routine, patience, and someone who understands that not every dragon needs to be a weapon. | T2 |
| **Vermax** | **Prowess** | Young and eager to fight. Vermax bonded to Jacaerys, who was trained as a warrior from childhood. He responds to martial energy and a willingness to test yourself. | T2 |
| **Moondancer** | **Fortitude** | Fierce beyond her size. Baela's dragon fought a crippled Sunfyre and nearly won despite being half his size. Moondancer respects stubbornness, endurance, and the refusal to back down — she needs a rider who won't flinch when things get hard. | T2 |
| **Arrax** | **Presence** | Small and fearful. Arrax needs reassurance, not dominance. A calm, soothing presence — someone who makes the young dragon feel safe. | T1 |
| **Tyraxes** | **Stewardship** | Timid and underdeveloped. Like Syrax, Tyraxes responds to patient caretaking and gentle handling. | T1 |
| **Stormcloud** | **Fortitude** | The bravest originally-fledgling dragon. Stormcloud carried Aegon III through dragonfire over the Gullet and died of his wounds. He responds to courage and endurance — someone who won't abandon him when the world burns. | T1 |

---

## 4. Difficulty Class

### 4.1 Base DC by Tier

| Tier | Base DC | Critical Failure Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **T1 — Fledgling** | 2 | 0 successes |
| **T2 — Blooded** | 3 | 0 successes |
| **T3 — War-Capable** | 5 | 1 or fewer successes |
| **T4 — Formidable** | 6 | 2 or fewer successes |
| **T5 — Apex** | 8 | 3 or fewer successes |

### 4.2 Wild Dragon Modifier

Dragons that have never been bonded are harder to claim. They have no concept of a rider and no inclination to accept one.

| Dragon | Base DC | Wild Modifier | Final DC |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sheepstealer** | 5 | +1 | **6** |
| **Grey Ghost** | 5 | +1 | **6** |
| **The Cannibal** | 8 | +2 | **10** |

The Cannibal's DC 10 is the highest in the game. He has never been bonded, he actively kills other dragons, and approaching him is the most dangerous thing a character can do in this system.

### 4.3 Outcome Table

| Successes | Outcome | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **DC or higher** | **Success** | The bond forms. The dragon accepts the rider. This is permanent and unbreakable until the death of either dragon or rider. |
| **Above critical threshold, below DC** | **Failure** | The dragon rejects the bonder. No bond forms. The bonder walks away alive but may never attempt this dragon again. The dragon remains available for others. |
| **Critical threshold or below** | **Critical Failure** | The dragon attacks. Roll on the Consequence Table (Section 4.4). The bonder may be scarred, maimed, or killed. This dragon is permanently hostile to this character. |

### 4.4 Critical Failure — Consequence Table

When a critical failure occurs, roll **1d20 + the dragon's Ferocity**:

| Total | Consequence | Mechanical Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **1-10** | **Scarred** | Dragonfire burns mark the character permanently. Cosmetic and narrative only — no mechanical penalty beyond the failed attempt. |
| **11-15** | **Maimed** | Loss of a hand, arm, or severe burns. Permanent **-1 to Prowess or Fortitude** (character's choice). |
| **16-20** | **Grievously Wounded** | Loss of a limb, eye, or crippling injury. Permanent **-2 to one aptitude** (staff determines which based on the injury). Extended recovery time. |
| **21-25** | **Near Death** | The character barely survives. Permanent **-2 to two aptitudes**. Bedridden for an extended period. |
| **26+** | **Death** | The dragon kills the bonder. The character is dead. |

**Ferocity impact examples:**
- Arrax (Ferocity 4): d20 + 4 = range 5-24. Scarring is most likely. Death requires a natural 20 + 4 = impossible (max 24, Near Death).
- Sunfyre (Ferocity 7): d20 + 7 = range 8-27. Maiming starts at roll 4. Death at roll 19+.
- Vhagar (Ferocity 10): d20 + 10 = range 11-30. Minimum result is Maimed. Death at roll 16+.
- The Cannibal (Ferocity 10): Same as Vhagar — minimum Maimed, Death at roll 16+. But the Cannibal's DC 10 and critical threshold of 3 mean you are *far more likely* to crit fail in the first place.

**Grey Ghost exception:** Grey Ghost (Ferocity 2) does not attack on critical failure. He flees. A critical failure against Grey Ghost means he vanishes — permanently unavailable for any future bonding attempt by anyone. He is not hostile. He is simply gone.

---

## 5. Personal Sacrifice

Sacrifice represents the bonder's willingness to pay a permanent price for the bond. All sacrifices must be declared **before** the roll. They are irrevocable regardless of outcome.

### 5.1 Sacrifice Options

| Sacrifice | Bonus Dice | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **Minor Bloodletting** | +1 | Cut your palm and offer your blood to the dragon. The bonder must have Dragonseed blood. |
| **Major Bloodletting** | +2 | Deep, deliberate cuts — significant blood loss. Narrative scarring. Dragonseed blood required. |
| **Self-Maiming** | +3 | Sacrifice a hand, fingers, or eye before the attempt. Permanent **-1 to Prowess or Fortitude**. Only one self-maiming per attempt. |
| **Human Sacrifice** | +4 | Sacrifice a living person with the blood of Old Valyria. The victim must be a Dragonseed — killing a commoner does nothing. The victim dies. |

### 5.2 Sacrifice Constraints

- **Maximum sacrifice bonus: +4 dice.** Sacrifices do not stack beyond this cap. You cannot combine minor bloodletting (+1) and self-maiming (+3) and human sacrifice (+4) for +8. The cap is +4 total from all sacrifice sources combined.
- **Human sacrifice is an Act of Tyranny.** It carries severe narrative and political consequences. Word will spread. The Faith will condemn you. Houses will turn against you. This is blood magic of the darkest kind.
- **The sacrificed person must have Dragonseed blood.** This is not an arbitrary cruelty — it is blood magic. The dragon responds to the blood of Old Valyria. Sacrificing a commoner, a Stark, or a Lannister does nothing. You are destroying a potential future dragonrider.
- **Self-maiming penalties apply immediately**, before the bonding roll affects anything else. If you sacrifice a hand, you are permanently at -1 Prowess or Fortitude whether or not the bond succeeds.

---

## 6. Ritual & Faith

### 6.1 Lore Ritual

An **assisting player** with high Lore may perform a Valyrian bonding ritual — ancient words, fire offerings, readings from dragonlore texts. This requires at least one full day of preparation before the bonding attempt.

The ritual is a **Lore aptitude check** rolled by the assistant (not the bonder):

| Assistant's Lore | Bonus Dice |
|---|---|
| 1-4 | 0 (Lore too low to perform the ritual) |
| 5-9 | +1 |
| 10 | +2 |

The bonder's own Lore score does **not** contribute here — this bonus comes from a knowledgeable assistant (a Maester, a scholar, a lorekeeper). If the bonder has no assistant with sufficient Lore, this bonus is unavailable.

### 6.2 Faith Invocation

An **assisting player** with high Faith may invoke their religion before the attempt — prayer, blessing, or spiritual preparation.

The invocation is a **Faith aptitude check** rolled by the assistant (not the bonder):

| Assistant's Faith | Bonus Dice |
|---|---|
| 1-4 | 0 (insufficient Faith) |
| 5-9 | +1 |
| 10 | +2 |

**R'hllor bonus:** Followers of R'hllor — the Lord of Light, god of fire and shadow — gain **+1 additional die** on Faith Invocation. R'hllor's domain is fire, and dragons are fire made flesh. Maximum Faith Invocation for R'hllor: +3.

Other faiths (The Seven, Old Gods, Drowned God) cap at +2.

The bonder's own Faith score does **not** contribute here — this bonus comes from a devout assistant (a Septon, a Red Priest, a woods witch). If the bonder has no assistant with sufficient Faith, this bonus is unavailable.

---

## 7. Group Assistance

### 7.1 How Assistance Works

Up to **4 allies** may assist the bonding attempt. Each assistant:

1. **Declares their action** — how they are helping. Examples:
   - A knight stands guard at the dragon's flank, projecting calm authority (Prowess or Command)
   - A Maester recites ancient Valyrian bonding lore to steady the bonder's approach (Lore)
   - A Septon prays over the bonder (Faith)
   - A courtier speaks soothingly to the dragon (Presence)
2. **Rolls their own pool** — staff determines the relevant aptitude based on the declared action. The assistant rolls that many d6s.
3. **Threshold: 2 successes.** If the assistant rolls 2 or more successes (4+ on d6), they contribute **+1 die** to the bonder's pool. If they roll fewer than 2 successes, their help was ineffective — no bonus.

### 7.2 Assistance Constraints

- **Maximum 4 assistants, maximum +4 dice from assistance.**
- **Assistants do NOT need to be Dragonseeds.** A Maester, a Septon, a knight — anyone with relevant aptitudes can help. They are not bonding with the dragon; they are supporting the bonder.
- **Assistants are at risk.** If the bonding results in a critical failure and the dragon attacks, assistants are in the danger zone. Staff adjudicates assistant casualties narratively based on the severity of the critical failure.

---

## 8. Probability Reference

### 8.1 Success Probability by Pool Size

For reference, the probability of achieving N or more successes from a pool of d6s (each 50% chance, success on 4+):

| Pool | DC 2 (T1) | DC 3 (T2) | DC 5 (T3) | DC 6 (T4/Wild T3) | DC 8 (T5) | DC 10 (Cannibal) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5d6 | 97% | 81% | 19% | 7% | <1% | — |
| 7d6 | 99% | 94% | 50% | 27% | 4% | <1% |
| 10d6 | >99% | 99% | 83% | 62% | 17% | 2% |
| 12d6 | >99% | >99% | 93% | 79% | 33% | 6% |
| 14d6 | >99% | >99% | 97% | 91% | 54% | 15% |
| 16d6 | >99% | >99% | 99% | 96% | 72% | 29% |
| 18d6 | >99% | >99% | >99% | 99% | 85% | 47% |
| 20d6 | >99% | >99% | >99% | >99% | 93% | 64% |
| 23d6 | >99% | >99% | >99% | >99% | 99% | 85% |

*Note: Since both d10 (6+) and d6 (4+) have a 50% success rate per die, the probability table is identical. The change to d6 unifies the dice system without affecting bonding odds.*

### 8.2 Worked Examples

**Example 1: Claiming Silverwing (DC 6) — Well-Prepared**

A noble lady with strong Presence wants to claim Silverwing.
- Presence 8 (favored aptitude)
- Allied Maester performs Lore Ritual (Lore 7) → +1
- Allied Septon performs Faith Invocation (Faith 5) → +1
- Minor bloodletting → +1
- 2 assistants succeed their rolls → +2

**Pool: 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 13d6 vs DC 6**
Expected successes: 6.5. Success rate: **~85%.** Good odds with significant preparation. As it should be — Silverwing is the most willing unbonded dragon.

**Example 2: Claiming Vermithor (DC 8) — Bold Attempt**

A military commander with the blood of the dragon approaches the Bronze Fury.
- Command 7 (favored aptitude)
- Allied Maester performs Lore Ritual (Lore 8) → +1
- Major bloodletting → +2
- 3 assistants succeed → +3

**Pool: 7 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 13d6 vs DC 8**
Expected successes: 6.5. Success rate: **~40%.** Real risk even with heavy investment. Without the assistants it drops to 10d6 → ~17%. Very dangerous.

**Example 3: The Cannibal (DC 10) — Maximum Investment**

A character throws everything at the most dangerous dragon in the world.
- Fortitude 9 (favored aptitude)
- Allied Maester performs Lore Ritual (Lore 10) → +2
- R'hllor Red Priest performs Faith Invocation (Faith 10) → +3
- Human sacrifice of a Dragonseed → +4
- 4 assistants succeed → +4

**Pool: 9 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 22d6 vs DC 10**
Expected successes: 11.0. Success rate: **~82%.**
But this requires: Fortitude 9, a Maester with Lore 10, a Red Priest with Faith 10, the murder of a Dragonseed, and four successful assistants. This is the single most expensive thing a character can do in the entire game. And there is still an 18% chance of failure.

**Example 4: Unprepared T5 Attempt (DC 8) — Suicide**

A Dragonseed with no preparation walks up to Vermithor.
- Command 6, no ritual, no sacrifice, no help

**Pool: 6d6 vs DC 8**
Expected successes: 3.0. Success rate: **~1%.** Critical failure rate: **~34%.** This is a suicide mission. The dragon will probably kill you.

## 9. Special Cases

### 9.1 Sheepstealer — The Bribery Precedent

In the lore, Nettles bonded Sheepstealer not through ritual or sacrifice, but by bringing him sheep every day until he accepted her. The bonding system accommodates this through the staff-gated approval:

- Staff may rule that a creative, sustained RP approach (like Nettles' sheep) grants bonus dice to the pool (replacing or supplementing other bonuses)
- The favored aptitude (Cunning) and the dice roll still apply — Nettles was clever, and the system reflects that
- This is not a loophole. Staff approval is still required, and the roll still determines the outcome.

### 9.2 Already-Bonded Dragons

If a dragon's current rider dies, the dragon becomes unbonded. However:
- The dragon is grieving and hostile. Staff determines when the dragon is available for bonding attempts (this may be days, weeks, or months after the rider's death).
- A recently-unbonded dragon may have a temporary DC increase (+1 or +2) at staff discretion, reflecting its unsettled state.
- Staff adjudicates this narratively. There is no fixed rule for "how long after rider death."

### 9.3 Eggs and Hatchlings

Dragon eggs that hatch in the presence of a Dragonseed child may bond automatically — this is how most Targaryen bonds form. No roll is required for cradle bonds. The system in this document applies only to claiming an existing, unbonded dragon.

### 9.4 Multiple Attempts (Different Dragons)

A character who fails with one dragon may attempt another, subject to:
- Staff approval for the new attempt
- The same preparation requirements apply fresh — ritual, sacrifice, etc. must be arranged again
- Previous failures are narrative knowledge. Other characters (and staff) know you failed.
- There is no mechanical penalty for a previous failure, but the narrative consequences are real.

---

## 10. Integration Points

- **`is_dragon_seed` flag** in character applications gates bonding eligibility
- **Dragonblood** in the Destiny system may grant bonus aptitude points at creation — useful for building toward a bonding-optimized character
- **Act of Tyranny** framework applies to human sacrifice consequences
- **War Priest** ability (Faith-based) may provide Faith Invocation assistance during bonding
- **Dragon movement speed** (0.01 px/s) and combat stats are unaffected by the bonding method — the bond grants the rider, not power to the dragon
- **Rider bonus** (+offense from Prowess/Command, +defense from Cunning/Fortitude) activates upon successful bond and applies to all dragon combat going forward

---

## 11. Design Rationale

### Why Favored Aptitudes Instead of a Generic Roll?

Every dragon is different. A system where every bonding attempt uses the same stat makes all Dragonseeds interchangeable — the one with the highest Presence always wins. Favored Aptitudes force strategic choices: *which dragon should I try to bond?* A Cunning 9 spymaster is terrible at approaching Vermithor (Command) but perfect for Sheepstealer. A Command 8 general is wasted on Syrax (Stewardship). This creates interesting decisions and rewards players who study the dragons.

### Why Is the Cannibal DC 10?

The Cannibal has never been bonded in the entire history of dragonkind. He kills other dragons. He eats dragon eggs. Approaching him is not brave — it is insane. DC 10 means that even with maximum possible investment (~22d6), you have a ~82% chance of success but an ~18% chance of the most dangerous creature alive trying to eat you. Without extreme preparation, success is effectively impossible. This is intentional. The Cannibal is the final boss.

### Why Cap Sacrifice at +4?

Without a cap, sacrifice becomes the dominant strategy — just maim yourself more for more dice. The cap ensures that sacrifice is *one tool among several*, not the only path. A character who sacrifices a hand (+3) and does nothing else is still worse off than a character who does minor bloodletting (+1), brings three assistants (+3), and performs a ritual (+1). Preparation is holistic.

### Why Can Assistants Be Non-Dragonseeds?

Bonding is a communal event, not a solo performance. In the lore, dragonriders are supported by dragonkeepers, maesters, septons, and lords. Restricting assistance to Dragonseeds would be narratively limiting and mechanically punishing. The assistant is not bonding — they are supporting the one who is.

### Why Three Outcomes Instead of Five?

The user specified three tiers: Critical Failure, Failure, and Success. This keeps the system clean and the stakes binary where they matter most — you either bond or you don't. The critical failure consequence table (Section 4.4) provides graduated severity within the "dragon attacks" outcome, giving the system depth without adding mechanical complexity to the core resolution.
