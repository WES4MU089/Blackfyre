## 1. Design Pillars

### Law Shapes War

The Seven Kingdoms are not lawless. Oaths, customs, and sacred rights constrain how lords wage war. A lord who fights within the law fights with the realm behind him. A lord who breaks the law fights alone — or worse, finds the realm turned against him.

### Consequences, Not Restrictions

The system does not prevent tyrannical actions — it ensures they have **consequences**. A king can execute a lord without trial. He just can't do it without the realm noticing, and the realm remembering.

### NPC Compliance as the Lever

Player characters make their own choices. The mechanical weight of this system falls on **NPC behavior** — NPC vassal lords, NPC holdings, and NPC-controlled forces. When a player lord acts justly, NPCs follow eagerly. When a player lord acts tyrannically, NPCs drag their feet, muster fewer men, and may eventually refuse entirely.

---

## 2. The Laws of Protection

### The Feudal Contract

The realm operates on a chain of sworn oaths flowing downward:

```
THE CROWN
  └── Oath of Protection → LORD PARAMOUNTS
        └── Oath of Protection → VASSAL LORDS
              └── Duty of Care → SMALLFOLK
```

Each link in the chain carries an obligation: **the powerful protect the weak in exchange for service and obedience.** When a lord calls his banners, his vassals answer because the oath demands it. When a lord fails to protect, the oath frays.

### What the Law Demands

| Obligation | Who Owes It | To Whom | What It Means |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Protection** | Crown, Lords | Vassals, Smallfolk | Defend them when attacked. Respond to threats. |
| **Justice** | Crown, Lords | All highborn | Fair trial before punishment. No execution without due process. |
| **Ransom** | Captors | Highborn prisoners | Prisoners of war of noble blood must be offered ransom, not executed. |
| **Guest Right** | Hosts | Guests | Those who share bread and salt are sacred. Violating this is the deepest taboo. |
| **Right of Combat** | Courts | Any highborn accused | A lord, lady, knight, or acknowledged bastard may demand Trial by Combat at any point during their trial. |
| **Declaration** | Aggressors | Defenders | War must be formally declared before hostilities. Attacking without declaration is dishonorable. |

### The Sacred Rights of Noble Blood

Any person of highborn station — lords, ladies, knights, acknowledged bastards — holds the following rights under the laws of the Seven Kingdoms:

- **Right to trial before punishment** — no highborn may be executed, stripped of lands, or permanently imprisoned without a trial among their peers
- **Right to Trial by Combat** — at any point during a trial, the accused may demand that the Gods decide their fate through combat
- **Right to ransom** — highborn prisoners of war must be offered terms of ransom, not killed
- **Right to petition** — a vassal may petition their liege for protection, justice, or redress of grievances

Denying any of these rights is an **Act of Tyranny**.

---

## 3. Noble Law & Authority

### The Hierarchy of Power

Authority in the Seven Kingdoms flows from the Crown downward. Each tier of the feudal hierarchy holds specific powers — and specific limits. Overstepping those limits is not just dishonorable, it's illegal.

```
THE CROWN (King / Queen)
  └── LORD PARAMOUNTS (Wardens of the great regions)
        └── VASSAL LORDS (Bannermen, landed knights)
              └── HOUSEHOLD (Retainers, servants, smallfolk)
```

### Crown Authority

The King sits atop the feudal order. His authority is the broadest in the realm, but it is not unlimited — a king who acts without regard for law and custom is a tyrant, and tyranny has consequences.

**The Crown alone can:**

| Power | Description |
|---|---|
| **Create or destroy Lord Paramounts** | Elevate a house to paramount status, or strip it. The most dramatic use of royal authority. |
| **Legitimize bastards** | Only the Crown can transform a bastard into a trueborn noble with full rights and claims. |
| **Grant lands anywhere in the realm** | Override regional authority to grant holdings, titles, or domains. |
| **Attaint any house** | Formally strip a house of all titles, lands, and rights — the legal death of a noble line. |
| **Override a Lord Paramount's decisions** | The Crown can reverse a regional ruling, but doing so carelessly breeds resentment. |
| **Decree royal law** | Establish laws that bind the entire realm. |
| **Command military action by decree** | A royal decree is strong casus belli — Crown vassals muster at full strength. |

**The cost of overreach:** A king who overrides Lord Paramounts too freely, grants away lands that aren't his to give, or attaints houses without just cause will find the great lords turning against him. The Crown's authority rests on legitimacy — and legitimacy can be lost.

### Lord Paramount Authority

Lord Paramounts rule their regions as the Crown's chosen wardens. Within their domain, they are the highest authority below the King. They manage the vassal hierarchy, administer justice, and keep the King's peace in their lands.

**Lord Paramounts can:**

| Power | Description |
|---|---|
| **Create or destroy vassal lordships** | Elevate a landed knight to a lord, or strip a vassal of their seat — within their own domain. |
| **Grant or revoke lands** | Redistribute holdings among their vassals as reward or punishment. |
| **Manage the vassal hierarchy** | Determine who holds what, who answers to whom, and how the domain is organized. |
| **Administer regional justice** | Try vassals before their Small Council. Pass sentences within the bounds of noble law. |
| **Call their banners** | Summon vassal lords to war. Vassals are oath-bound to answer. |
| **Appoint landed knights** | Elevate men-at-arms or hedge knights to landed status with minor holdings. |
| **Collect taxes and levies** | Demand gold and manpower from vassals in accordance with custom. |

**Lord Paramounts cannot:**
- Legitimize bastards (Crown-only)
- Create new Lord Paramounts (Crown-only)
- Attaint a house without Crown authority or trial (attempting this is **Unjust Seizure** — an Act of Tyranny)
- Override the Crown's direct rulings

**The cost of overreach:** A Lord Paramount who strips vassals without cause, redistributes lands unfairly, or demands excessive taxes will see NPC vassals drift toward disloyalty. The same tyranny mechanics apply — unjust seizure, failure of protection, and denial of rights all carry consequences.

### Vassal Lord Authority

Vassal lords rule their own holdings and manage their households. Their authority is the narrowest but most personal — they are the lords their people see every day.

**Vassal Lords can:**

| Power | Description |
|---|---|
| **Rule their holdings** | Full authority over their own castles, towns, and lands. |
| **Manage their household** | Appoint retainers, castellans, and household officers. |
| **Acknowledge bastards** | Publicly claim a bastard as their own, granting them the regional surname (Snow, Rivers, Sand, etc.) and limited standing. |
| **Raise their levies** | Muster troops from their own holdings without requiring permission. |
| **Petition their liege** | Request protection, justice, land grants, or redress of grievances. |
| **Administer local justice** | Handle disputes among their smallfolk and minor household matters. |

**Vassal Lords cannot:**
- Legitimize bastards (Crown-only)
- Create new lordships (Lord Paramount authority)
- Declare independence without consequence (this is rebellion)
- Refuse the call to banners without consequence (this is oath-breaking)

### Bastards & Legitimacy

Blood matters in the Seven Kingdoms. The distinction between trueborn and bastard defines a person's rights, claims, and standing.

**Unacknowledged Bastards:**
- No noble rights whatsoever
- No surname, no standing, no claim
- Treated as smallfolk in the eyes of the law
- Cannot inherit, cannot hold titles, cannot demand trial by combat

**Acknowledged Bastards:**
- Receive the regional bastard surname (Snow, Rivers, Stone, Sand, Hill, Flowers, Storm, Waters, Pyke)
- Recognized as highborn for the purposes of **Trial by Combat** and **right to ransom**
- Cannot inherit ahead of trueborn children
- Can serve in household positions, hold minor offices
- Can petition their lord parent for support
- **Cannot** hold lordships or titles unless legitimized

**Legitimized Bastards (Crown-only):**
- Full trueborn noble rights — can inherit, hold titles, press claims
- Take the family name (Snow → Stark, Rivers → Tully, etc.)
- Enter the line of succession (typically behind existing trueborn children, unless the Crown specifies otherwise)
- Legitimization cannot be revoked once granted — it is permanent

**Regional Bastard Surnames:**

| Region | Surname |
|---|---|
| The North | Snow |
| Riverlands | Rivers |
| The Vale | Stone |
| Dorne | Sand |
| Westerlands | Hill |
| The Reach | Flowers |
| Stormlands | Storm |
| Crownlands | Waters |
| Iron Islands | Pyke |

### Oaths & Their Weight

Oaths are not mere words in the Seven Kingdoms — they are the foundation of the social order. Every link in the feudal chain is forged by a sworn oath, and breaking one carries real consequences.

**Oath of Fealty:**
Sworn by a vassal to their liege. Binds the vassal to answer the call to banners, pay taxes, and obey lawful commands. In return, the liege owes protection and justice. Breaking this oath is grounds for **moderate casus belli** against the oathbreaker.

**Oath of the Night's Watch:**
"I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory." A man who takes the black renounces **all** titles, lands, claims, and family ties. He is legally dead to the realm. The Watch is permanent — desertion is punishable by death.

- **Taking the black** is a recognized alternative to execution. A convicted lord may be offered the Wall instead of the headsman's axe.
- A lord who takes the black **immediately forfeits** all holdings, titles, and claims. His heir inherits.
- A bastard who takes the black forfeits any hope of legitimization.
- The Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the realm — this is sacrosanct.

**Maester's Chain:**
Maesters serve the castle, not the lord. When a holdfast changes hands, the maester remains. They forswear family names and inheritance. Their neutrality is respected by all — harming a maester in his service is deeply taboo.

### Attainder

Attainder is the legal destruction of a noble house — the most extreme non-violent punishment the realm can inflict.

**What attainder does:**
- Strips the house of **all** titles, lands, and holdings
- Bars all members of the house from holding noble titles
- Voids all sworn oaths to the attainted house (vassals are released)
- The house name is effectively dead

**Who can attaint:**
- The **Crown** can attaint any house in the realm
- A **Lord Paramount** can petition the Crown for attainder of a vassal house, or declare forfeiture within their domain (requires trial or overwhelming just cause)

**Attainder without trial** is an Act of Tyranny (**Unjust Seizure**, moderate severity — or **Execution Without Trial** at severe severity if combined with killing). Even justified attainder is a dramatic act that makes other lords nervous — if he can do it to them, he can do it to me.

### Taxation & Obligation

The feudal contract includes economic obligations. Lords owe their liege a share of their wealth in exchange for protection and justice.

| Obligation | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Crown Tax** | Vassal → Crown | Lord Paramounts owe the Crown a portion of their domain's income |
| **Liege Tax** | Vassal → Lord Paramount | Vassal lords owe their Lord Paramount a portion of their holdings' income |
| **Military Levy** | Vassal → Liege | When banners are called, vassals must provide men proportional to their holdings |
| **Emergency Levy** | Liege → Vassal | In times of crisis, a liege may demand extraordinary taxation — but excessive demands breed resentment |

**Excessive taxation** is not technically an Act of Tyranny, but it erodes NPC vassal loyalty over time. A lord who bleeds his vassals dry will find them slow to answer the next call to banners.

---

## 4. Acts of Tyranny

### Definition

An Act of Tyranny is a violation of the established laws and customs of the Seven Kingdoms by a lord or ruler against those under their authority or protection. Each act carries consequences that erode a ruler's legitimacy and their NPCs' willingness to serve.

### The Acts

| Act | Description | Severity | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Execution Without Trial** | Killing a highborn without due process | Severe | Joffrey executing Ned Stark |
| **Denial of Trial by Combat** | Refusing a highborn's sacred right to demand judgment by the Gods | Severe | Heretical — violates divine law |
| **Execution of Prisoners of War** | Killing highborn captives instead of ransoming them | Severe | Breaking the customs of war |
| **Killing the Yielded** | Slaying a highborn who has surrendered or yielded in combat | Severe | A yielded man has placed his life in your hands — killing him is murder, not war |
| **Violation of Guest Right** | Harming those under your roof who have shared bread and salt | Extreme | The Red Wedding |
| **Kinslaying** | Killing your own blood | Extreme | Cursed by Gods and men |
| **War Without Declaration** | Attacking another lord without formal declaration of hostilities | Moderate | Dishonorable — the realm takes notice |
| **Failure of Protection** | Refusing to defend vassals when they are attacked | Moderate | Breaking the fundamental oath |
| **Unjust Seizure** | Taking lands, titles, or property without legal basis | Moderate | Tyrannical overreach |

### Mechanical Consequences

Acts of Tyranny affect NPC behavior on a sliding scale. The more acts committed, the worse the consequences:

**NPC Mustering Penalties:**

| Tyranny Level | NPC Mustering Effect |
|---|---|
| **Clean** (no acts) | Full mustering — NPCs answer the call at normal speed and strength |
| **Stained** (1-2 moderate acts) | -15% NPC manpower commitment, +1 tick mustering delay |
| **Feared** (1 severe act or 3+ moderate) | -30% NPC manpower, +2 tick delay, some NPCs may refuse |
| **Reviled** (2+ severe acts or extreme act) | -50% NPC manpower, +3 tick delay, NPC defection risk |
| **Tyrant** (multiple severe/extreme acts) | NPC vassals may refuse entirely, rebel, or defect to enemies |

**Additional NPC Effects:**
- **Loyalty erosion** — NPC vassals drift toward disloyalty over time while tyranny persists
- **Defection risk** — at high tyranny, NPC vassals may switch allegiance when offered an alternative by a lord with legitimate casus belli
- **Smallfolk unrest** — holdings produce less income, higher chance of peasant revolt events
- **Diplomatic isolation** — NPC lords outside your domain are less willing to ally or negotiate

### Tyranny Decay

Tyranny does not persist forever. Over time, acts fade from memory — but severe and extreme acts take far longer:

| Severity | Decay Rate |
|---|---|
| **Moderate** | Fades after ~30 ticks (1 month) of no new acts |
| **Severe** | **Never decays** — the realm does not forget butchery, denial of sacred rights, or the murder of prisoners |
| **Extreme** | **Never decays** — kinslaying and violation of guest right stain a house permanently |

Good deeds (protecting vassals, just trials, honoring ransoms) can accelerate the decay of moderate acts but cannot erase severe or extreme ones. A lord who executes prisoners or kills the yielded carries that stain for life.

## 5. Casus Belli

### What Is Casus Belli?

Casus belli is a **recognized justification for war**. When a lord has legitimate cause, the realm understands why swords are drawn. When a lord lacks cause, the realm sees an aggressor — and responds accordingly.

### Casus Belli Sources

| Casus Belli | Trigger | Strength | NPC Mustering Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Act of Tyranny against your house** | Any Act of Tyranny directed at you, your family, or your vassals | Strong | Full mustering + morale bonus |
| **Violation of Laws of Protection** | Your liege failed to protect you when attacked | Strong | Full mustering |
| **Broken oath** | A vassal deserted your war, refused the call to banners, or betrayed their sworn fealty | Strong | Full mustering — treason demands answer |
| **Disputed succession** | Two or more claimants to the same seat or title | Moderate | Mustering based on claim legitimacy |
| **Territorial claim** | Historical or legal claim to lands held by another | Weak | -10% NPC manpower (seen as opportunistic) |
| **Royal decree** | The King commands military action | Strong (if King is legitimate) | Full mustering from Crown vassals |
| **Defense** | You are being attacked | Automatic — strongest | Full mustering + morale bonus + defensive Advantage |
| **No casus belli** | Unprovoked aggression | None | -30% NPC manpower, +2 tick delay, loyalty erosion |

### Casus Belli + Tyranny Stack

A lord who commits Acts of Tyranny AND lacks casus belli faces compounding penalties:

```
Lord Tywin attacks Lord Stark without casus belli:
  No casus belli: -30% NPC manpower, +2 tick delay
  (If Tywin also has "Stained" tyranny: additional -15%)
  Total: -45% NPC manpower, +3 tick delay

Meanwhile, Lord Stark is defending (automatic casus belli):
  Defense: full mustering + morale bonus
  Tyranny: Clean — no penalties
  Total: 100% NPC mustering + starting morale bonus
```

The aggressor without cause faces an uphill battle before swords are even drawn.

### Casus Belli Is Public

Casus belli is not secret. When war is declared, the stated cause is known to all. NPC lords evaluate the legitimacy of the claim — a flimsy justification fools no one.

---

## 6. War Declaration

### The Moderator Petition Process

War is not declared on a whim. Before a lord can formally declare war, they must **petition the moderator team** for recognition of their casus belli. This is the single point where the system touches player conflict — everything else is roleplay.

**The process:**

1. **The petitioner submits a war petition** to the moderator team, stating:
   - Who they intend to declare war against
   - Their justification — what grievance, offense, or claim drives this war
   - Their war goal — what they seek to achieve (see War Goals below)
   - Any supporting evidence — RP logs, witness accounts, prior rulings

2. **The moderator team reviews the petition** against the Casus Belli framework (Section 5), evaluating:
   - Does the stated justification match a recognized casus belli?
   - What strength does the CB warrant? (Strong, Moderate, Weak, or None)
   - Is the war goal proportionate to the grievance?

3. **The moderators issue their ruling:**
   - The **CB strength** is assigned — this determines NPC mustering effects for the duration of the war
   - The **war goal** is formally recognized — this frames what constitutes victory
   - The declaration is made **public** — all lords in the realm are notified

**The moderator team does not deny wars.** A lord can always choose to fight. What the moderators determine is whether the realm sees it as **justified** — and that determination drives NPC behavior. A lord who goes to war with no recognized CB will find his NPC vassals reluctant, his manpower depleted, and his reputation stained.

### Undeclared Attacks

A lord who attacks without going through the declaration process:
- Commits an **Act of Tyranny (moderate)** — War Without Declaration
- The defender gains **automatic strong casus belli** (defense against unprovoked aggression)
- NPC vassals of the attacker are reluctant — they weren't prepared for war and question the cause
- The realm views the attacker as dishonorable
- The attacker may still petition for CB **after** hostilities begin, but the act of attacking first is already on their record

### War Goals

The petitioner must state their **war goal** — what they seek to achieve. This frames the conflict and shapes what peace terms are considered legitimate:

| War Goal | Description | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| **Subjugation** | Force the enemy to bend the knee / accept vassalage | Target submits or is defeated militarily |
| **Territorial** | Seize specific holdings or lands | Contested holdings change hands |
| **Punitive** | Punish for a specific offense (tyranny, oath-breaking) | Target pays reparations, gives hostages, or faces penalties |
| **Liberation** | Free a vassal from a tyrannical liege | Target lord loses the contested vassal |
| **Succession** | Press a claim to a title or seat | Claimant installed or claim rejected |
| **Independence** | Break free from a liege's authority | Vassal becomes independent or is forced back |

War goals determine what constitutes "winning" and shape the RP negotiations that follow.

---

## 7. Peace & Surrender

### RP-Driven Resolution

Peace is negotiated between players, not enforced by mechanics. There is no warscore. There is no timer. War ends when the people fighting it decide it ends — through negotiation, surrender, or the complete destruction of one side's ability to resist.

> **Battlefield surrender** has mechanical rules — see `warfare-foundation.md` §14.4. Battlefield surrender is unconditional (auto-capture, 100% inventory, army disbands). Siege surrender remains RP-negotiated (`siege-mechanics.md` §9.1). The peace terms below apply to **war-ending negotiations**, not individual battle outcomes.

The system provides **pressure**, not resolution:
- **Your armies are destroyed** — you cannot field men because your men are dead
- **Your holdings are occupied** — your economy is gone, your levies cannot muster
- **Your lord is captured** — your leadership is in chains
- **Your vassals defect** — NPC lords refuse to fight, switch sides, or simply go home
- **Your smallfolk revolt** — your domain tears itself apart from within
- **Your coffers are empty** — you cannot pay, feed, or equip what remains

A lord with nothing left to fight with doesn't need a system to tell him the war is over. Players negotiate the terms themselves.

### Guidelines for Peace

The following are **RP frameworks** — not system mechanics. They exist to give players and moderators a shared vocabulary for how wars end.

**Forms of peace:**
- **Surrender** — the loser accepts the winner's terms in full
- **Negotiated Peace** — both sides agree to partial terms, a compromise
- **White Peace** — both sides agree to stop fighting with no terms exchanged
- **Imposed by Higher Authority** — the Crown or a Lord Paramount commands both sides to cease fighting (defiance is oath-breaking)

**Common peace terms:** land cession, gold reparations, forfeiture of claims, oaths of fealty, hostage exchange, prisoner return, marriage pacts, ward surrender, territorial withdrawal, attainder (requires Crown or LP authority)

**The weight of peace oaths:** A peace deal sworn before witnesses is a binding oath under noble law. Breaking the terms of a sworn peace is **oath-breaking** — strong casus belli for the wronged party to petition the moderators and resume hostilities.

**Truces** are temporary pauses, not peace deals. No terms are exchanged. Breaking a truce is dishonorable but not technically oath-breaking — it stains reputation and NPC lords take note.

---

## 8. Trial & Justice

### Trial Among Peers

When a highborn is accused of a crime, they are entitled to a trial among their peers:

- **Vassal lords** are tried before the **Small Council of their Lord Paramount**
- **Lord Paramounts and major nobles** are tried before the **King's Small Council**
- The accused has the right to speak in their defense, present witnesses, and call upon character

### Trial by Combat

At **any point** during a trial, including after a sentence is passed, the accused may invoke their sacred right to **Trial by Combat** — demanding that the Gods decide their guilt or innocence.

**The belief:** The Gods favor truth. Victory in combat proves innocence. Defeat proves guilt.

**Mechanics:**
- Either the accused fights personally, or they may name a **champion** to fight on their behalf
- The accuser (or the Crown) must also provide a combatant
- The duel resolves using the personal combat system (detailed in Commanders & Personal Combat doc)
- **Victory** = acquittal. The accused goes free.
- **Defeat** = guilty. Sentence is carried out.

**Denying Trial by Combat** when lawfully invoked is an **Act of Tyranny (severe)** — it violates both noble law and divine authority. Even a King cannot deny this right without consequence.

### Trial by Seven

The most sacred and rarely invoked form of divine judgment. Where Trial by Combat asks the Gods to choose between two fighters, Trial by Seven asks **all seven aspects of the God** to render judgment — seven champions on each side, fighting as one.

**Who can invoke it:** Only members of the **royal family** — the King, Queen, princes, and princesses of the blood. No lord, no matter how powerful, can demand a Trial by Seven. It is the exclusive right of the Crown's bloodline.

**How it works:**
- Each side must assemble **seven champions** — the accused or accuser may fight as one of their own seven
- If either side **cannot field seven**, the trial cannot proceed — an inability to find champions is seen as the Gods' judgment in itself
- All fourteen fight simultaneously — a **melee**, not sequential duels
- The trial ends when one side has no fighters left standing (death, yield, or incapacitation)
- Victory means acquittal. Defeat means guilt.

**Why it matters:**
- Trial by Seven is a **political event** — assembling seven champions willing to risk death for your cause is itself a test of loyalty and alliances
- Casualties on **both sides** are expected. Even the victors may lose champions. A prince who invokes this asks men to die for him.
- The Faith considers it the **holiest** form of trial — the Gods speak with the clearest voice when all seven aspects are present
- Only recognized where the **Faith of the Seven** holds authority. The Old Gods, R'hllor, and the Drowned God offer no such rite.

**Denying Trial by Seven** to a royal who lawfully invokes it carries the same consequences as denying Trial by Combat — an **Act of Tyranny (severe)**. The Faith would consider it heresy.

### Consequences of Unjust Trials

A trial perceived as unjust — rigged proceedings, denial of rights, predetermined outcomes — generates casus belli for the accused's house and allies. The worse the injustice, the stronger the cause:

- Unfair trial → **moderate casus belli** for the accused's allies
- Denial of Trial by Combat → **strong casus belli** + Act of Tyranny
- Execution without any trial → **strongest casus belli** + severe Act of Tyranny

---

## 9. Smallfolk Unrest

Tyranny and occupation create unrest among the common people. Unrest manifests as production penalties and, at extreme levels, armed revolt.

### 9.1 Unrest Sources

| Source | Production Penalty | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Tyranny (Stained)** | -10% | Minor grumbling, slower work |
| **Tyranny (Feared)** | -20% | Fear suppresses productivity |
| **Tyranny (Reviled)** | -30% | Open resentment, sabotage |
| **Tyranny (Tyrant)** | -40% | Near-revolt conditions |
| **Occupation (same region, new lord)** | -50% (decays over 6 months) | See holdings-system.md §3.2 |
| **Occupation (different region)** | -25% permanent | Foreign rule never fully accepted |

Tyranny and occupation penalties **stack** — a tyrannical foreign occupier suffers both.

### 9.2 Peasant Revolt

At **Reviled** tyranny or higher, a holding has a chance each tick of spawning a **peasant revolt event**:

- **Revolt army:** 20–30% of the settlement's total manpower, composed entirely of Levy (no Men-at-Arms or Elite — angry farmers with pitchforks)
- **Revolt behavior:** The army spawns inside the holding and immediately attacks the garrison. If the garrison is absent or too weak, the revolt takes the holding.
- **Revolt resolution:** The lord must divert forces to suppress the revolt, or lose the holding until it is retaken
- **Revolt aftermath:** A suppressed revolt kills the revolting manpower permanently — the settlement's manpower pool is reduced. This makes tyranny self-destructive over time.

Revolt chance per tick is not a fixed percentage — it is a **staff-triggered event** based on narrative circumstances. The system provides the conditions; staff decide when it fires.

---

## 10. Reputation Tracking

### 10.1 Event Log System

Tyranny is tracked as an **event log**, not a numerical score. Each Act of Tyranny is recorded with:

- **The act committed** (which Act from §4)
- **Severity** (Moderate, Severe, Extreme)
- **Date** (tick number)
- **Target** (who was wronged)

The system sums all active (non-decayed) acts to determine the lord's current **tyranny tier** (Clean → Stained → Feared → Reviled → Tyrant).

### 10.2 Why Event-Based, Not Numerical

- **Transparency:** Players and staff can see exactly what a lord has done, not just a number
- **Context:** "Executed Lord Stark without trial" tells a story that "-15 reputation" does not
- **NPC memory:** NPC lords remember specific acts. A lord who violated guest right is treated differently than one who seized lands without cause, even if both are "Feared" tier
- **Decay clarity:** It's clear which acts have faded and which remain — moderate acts decay after 30 ticks of clean behavior, severe and extreme acts never decay

### 10.3 NPC Awareness

NPC lords in the **same region** are immediately aware of Acts of Tyranny. NPC lords in **other regions** learn of acts with a delay of 1–3 ticks (news travels). The Crown is always notified within 1 tick.

---

## 11. Balance Confirmation

The following values from §4 and §5 have been reviewed against the warfare simulation and are confirmed as balanced:

### 11.1 Tyranny Tier Thresholds

| Tier | Threshold | Confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| Clean | 0 active acts | Yes |
| Stained | 1–2 moderate acts | Yes |
| Feared | 1 severe OR 3+ moderate | Yes |
| Reviled | 2+ severe OR 1 extreme | Yes |
| Tyrant | Multiple severe/extreme | Yes |

### 11.2 NPC Mustering Penalties

| Tier | Manpower Penalty | Delay | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Clean | 0% | 0 ticks | — |
| Stained | -15% | +1 tick | Roughly equivalent to losing a small holding's contribution |
| Feared | -30% | +2 ticks | A 5,000-man army becomes 3,500 — significant |
| Reviled | -50% | +3 ticks | Half your NPC strength gone; defection risk begins |
| Tyrant | Up to -100% | — | NPC vassals may refuse entirely or rebel |

### 11.3 Interaction with Siege Balance

A tyrannical attacker faces compounding disadvantages:

```
Example: Tyrant lord (Reviled, -50% NPC manpower) attacks a standard fortress (+18 advantage)

  Normal army: 9,000 men (3:1 vs 3,000 defender) → 100% win
  After tyranny: 4,500 men (1.5:1 vs 3,000 defender) → 0% win

  The tyrant cannot even crack a standard fortress without
  massive personal forces or a dragon.
```

This creates a natural feedback loop: tyranny weakens your ability to wage war, which makes conquest harder, which makes further tyranny less viable.

## 12. Future Design (Deferred)

The following systems interact with the war-conflict framework but do not affect WBS combat mechanics directly. They will be designed in future phases:

- **Alliances & Pacts** — formal alliance mechanics, mutual defense treaties, marriage pacts as political tools
- **Succession Law** — inheritance rules, disputed claims, regency mechanics, primogeniture vs. other systems
- **Small Council Composition** — who sits on a Lord Paramount's council, mechanical roles for councillors
- **The Faith's Role** — mechanical authority to condemn tyranny, excommunication, sanctuary in a sept, interaction with Trial by Combat
- **Marriage Law** — the Faith officiates marriages, legal authority implications, marriage pacts as diplomatic tools
- **Wardship & Hostages** — fostering children as guarantees of loyalty, mechanical implications of holding wards, hostage execution as Act of Tyranny
