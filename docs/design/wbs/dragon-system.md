## 1. Design Pillars

### Dragons Are Characters

A dragon is not a weapon. It is not a mount. It is not equipment. A dragon is a **living character** with its own name, personality, temperament, stats, and will. It may serve a rider, but it is not owned — it is bonded. The distinction matters.

Every dragon in this system has a tier, stats, temperament, and history. Two dragons of the same tier can feel completely different — one a lumbering juggernaut, the other a serpentine killer. The system is built to make every dragon feel unique.

### Tiers Define the Hierarchy

Dragons exist in a **five-tier hierarchy** based on combat power — not size, not age, not reputation. Tier measures how dangerous a dragon actually is when fire meets scale.

Vhagar is Tier 5 because she is the largest living dragon with jaws that swallow horses and scales that deflect scorpion bolts. Caraxes is Tier 5 because he is the deadliest aerial fighter alive — lean, fast, and absolutely unwilling to stop killing. Both are apex predators. Both are Tier 5. They got there by completely different paths.

Syrax is Tier 2 despite being physically large enough to be a war dragon. She has never fought. She does not know how. Size gave her the body of a Tier 3 — but combat power is what the tier measures, and she has none.

The tier system answers one question: **if this dragon entered a fight, how dangerous would it be?**

### The Bond Is Sacred

A dragon bonds with one rider. A rider bonds with one dragon. This bond lasts until death — of the dragon or the rider. It cannot be transferred, traded, or broken by force. When a rider dies, the dragon becomes unbonded — and who claims it next reshapes the balance of power.

### Combat Power Is Not Size

The God's Eye proved it. Vhagar was the largest dragon alive. Caraxes killed her. Raw size can be overcome by speed, ferocity, and a willingness to die fighting. The tier system reflects this — a lean Elder with exceptional agility and ferocity sits at the same tier as an Ancient with overwhelming mass. Both are equally lethal. They are lethal in different ways.

Size influences stats — bigger dragons tend to have higher Might and Resilience — but it does not determine tier. A pampered Adult is less dangerous than a battle-tested Adolescent. What matters is what the dragon can do when steel meets scale and fire meets sky.

### Terror Is the Point

Dragons do not win wars through damage alone. They win wars because men **break** before the fire even comes. The morale effect of a dragon is its greatest weapon. An army that sees a Tier 5 dragon descending does not think about hit points — it thinks about running.

The tier system scales terror accordingly. A Tier 5 dragon on the battlefield can shatter an army's will to fight in a handful of ticks. A Tier 1 dragon is frightening, but men can hold their nerve. The difference between tiers is not just combat power — it is the psychological devastation a dragon inflicts by simply existing.

### Death Is Almost Certain

Dragon-versus-dragon combat is the most dramatic and consequential event in the game. It should also be the most dangerous. The Dance of the Dragons proved that when two dragons fight, at least one dies — and the victor rarely walks away whole.

The combat system is designed to produce this outcome. Same-tier fights are brutal coin flips. Cross-tier fights are steep uphill battles. In all cases, the loser dies and the winner is wounded. There are no safe dragon fights.

## 2. The Dragon as Character

### Dragon Character Sheet

Every dragon in the game world is a **named character** with its own record.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | The dragon's name (Vhagar, Caraxes, Sunfyre, Meleys, etc.) |
| **Color** | Scale and flame coloring — distinctive to each dragon |
| **Tier** | Combat power tier: T1 (Fledgling) through T5 (Apex). See Section 3. |
| **Size** | Physical size descriptor: Hatchling, Young, Adolescent, Adult, Elder, Ancient |
| **Age** | In years |
| **Bond Status** | Bonded (to whom), Unbonded, or Wild |
| **Stats** | Might, Agility, Ferocity, Resilience (see Section 4) |
| **Health** | Current HP and wound condition |
| **Location** | Where the dragon currently resides or roams |
| **History** | Notable events — battles fought, riders lost, wounds taken |

### Staff Creates, Players Control

- **Staff** determines how many dragons exist, where they are, their tier, and stats
- **Staff** manages dragon aging, tier advancement, and life events between sessions
- **Players** control their bonded dragon in combat, RP, and tactical decisions
- **Players** direct where the dragon goes, what it attacks, when it engages or withdraws
- When a bonded rider dies, the dragon becomes unbonded. Staff determines its immediate behavior until a new rider claims it.

### The Dragon Population

The setting is the **Dance of the Dragons era**, just before the civil war. The Targaryen dynasty is at its peak of dragon power — more living dragons than at any point since the Doom. Each dragon is a named, known, consequential presence. The full roster is defined in Section 7.

---

## 3. Dragon Tiers

### Five Tiers of Power

Every dragon is assigned a **combat power tier** from T1 to T5. Tier represents overall threat level — how dangerous the dragon is in a fight. It is the single most important number on a dragon's sheet.

Tier is not size. Tier is not age. Tier is the answer to the question: **how many dragons could kill this one, and how many could it kill?**

| Tier | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **T5** | **Apex** | The deadliest dragons alive. Each one can turn a war. They dominate the skies, shatter armies, and terrify kingdoms. Only another T5 can fight them with any hope of survival. |
| **T4** | **Formidable** | Powerful dragons — old, experienced, dangerous. True war dragons that can devastate formations and hold their own in aerial combat. Outclassed by T5s, but not helpless. |
| **T3** | **War-Capable** | Standard battlefield dragons. Can carry an armored rider, strafe enemy armies, and fight other dragons — but at serious disadvantage against anything above their tier. |
| **T2** | **Blooded** | Young or untested dragons. Dangerous to men, vulnerable to dragons. Can fight but should not seek it. One solid engagement with a higher-tier dragon ends them. |
| **T1** | **Fledgling** | Very young, fragile, barely combat-capable. Their fire can kill men, but a scorpion bolt can kill them. In dragon-vs-dragon combat, they are prey. |

### What Tier Means in Practice

**Tier determines three things mechanically:**

1. **HP multiplier** — Higher-tier dragons can absorb dramatically more punishment
2. **Damage per hit** — Higher-tier dragons hit harder when their attacks connect
3. **Terror and morale** — Higher-tier dragons have a greater psychological impact on armies

Stats (Might, Agility, Ferocity, Resilience) determine *how* a dragon fights. Tier determines *how much* that fighting matters. A T3 dragon with excellent stats will fight brilliantly — but each of its hits lands lighter and its body breaks faster than a T5's.

### Tier Gap Philosophy

The tier system is designed so that **cross-tier fights are difficult but not impossible**.

- **Same tier**: A fair fight. Stats determine the winner. Both dragons will take heavy damage.
- **1 tier apart**: Significant advantage to the higher tier. The lower-tier dragon can win, but it requires superior stats, circumstance (ambush, wounded opponent, terrain), or extraordinary luck.
- **2 tiers apart**: Near-suicide for the lower-tier dragon. Possible only in extreme circumstances — a fresh T3 catching a grievously wounded T5 that cannot disengage.
- **3+ tiers apart**: Execution. Vhagar versus Arrax. It is not a fight.

### Size vs. Tier

Size is retained as a **narrative descriptor** — Hatchling, Young, Adolescent, Adult, Elder, Ancient. Size matters for roleplay, for what the dragon can physically carry, for how it moves through the world. But size does not determine tier.

**Size influences stats** — bigger dragons tend to have higher Might and Resilience. A dragon cannot have Might 10 if it is the size of a horse. But the tier reflects the total combat picture: a lean Elder with Might 7, Agility 9, and Ferocity 10 can be Tier 5 alongside a massive Ancient with Might 10, Agility 3, and Resilience 10.

| Size | Typical Tier | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Ancient | T5 | Sheer mass and power — but only if combat-tested |
| Elder | T3-T5 | Wide range. Some are apex killers, some are gentle giants. |
| Adult | T2-T3 | Standard war dragons at T3, untested or pampered at T2 |
| Adolescent | T1-T2 | Growing, vulnerable, but some are fierce beyond their years |
| Young | T1 | Small, fragile, barely combat-capable |
| Hatchling | — | Cannot fight. Not assigned a combat tier. |

### Tier Advancement

**T1 and T2 dragons auto-grow.** Fledgling (T1) and Blooded (T2) dragons automatically advance one tier every 90 days. This represents the natural growth of young dragons — they are still maturing and their power increases steadily with time. T1 → T2 after 90 days, T2 → T3 after another 90 days.

**T3 and above are static.** Once a dragon reaches Tier 3 (War-Capable), its tier, stats, and size do not change during normal play. There is no growth system, no training mechanic, and no passive progression. The dragon you bond at T3+ is the dragon you have — its power level is fixed.

The only exception for T3+ is **staff-authorized promotion** for story direction. Staff may adjust a dragon's tier, stats, or size category when the narrative warrants it — during time jumps, after pivotal story moments, or as part of world events. These are rare, impactful decisions, not something players grind toward.

**Example:** Staff may promote Tessarion from T2 to T3 after her first real combat engagement demonstrates she has grown into a war-capable dragon — this is a staff decision during a story milestone. But her initial T1 → T2 growth happened automatically after 90 days.

## 4. Dragon Stats

### Four Core Stats

Four stats define a dragon's combat identity. Each ranges from **1 to 10**.

| Stat | Description | What It Drives |
|---|---|---|
| **Might** | Raw physical power — mass, jaw strength, fire volume. Primarily determined by size, but some dragons hit harder for their weight. | Fire damage against armies (strafe), physical damage (bite/claw) in aerial combat, HP pool |
| **Agility** | Speed, maneuverability, reflexes in the air. Smaller dragons tend to be faster, but some large dragons are surprisingly quick. | Initiative (who strikes first), evasion in aerial combat, ability to disengage, chance to dodge scorpion bolts |
| **Ferocity** | Combat instinct, aggression, killer instinct. Some dragons are fighters. Some are not. Ferocity is what separates a war dragon from a transport. | Damage output in aerial combat, determination (keeps fighting when wounded), terror effect on morale |
| **Resilience** | Toughness — scale thickness, wound tolerance, ability to absorb punishment and keep flying. Strongly tied to size but varies. | HP pool, defensive capability in aerial combat, resistance to anti-dragon weapons |

### Stat Ranges by Tier

Tier sets a **guideline** for total stat points. Staff assigns specific values based on the dragon's individual character.

| Tier | Stat Total | Typical Range per Stat | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T5** | 28-37 | 6-10 | At least one stat at 9-10. Can have a weakness (Vhagar's Agility 3). |
| **T4** | 22-28 | 4-8 | Solid across the board, no stat at 10. |
| **T3** | 18-25 | 3-9 | Capable but clearly outclassed by T4+. Stat totals can overlap with T4 — the tier reflects combat power, not raw numbers. |
| **T2** | 15-21 | 2-8 | Young or untested. May have one standout stat (Moondancer's Agility 8) but lacks the overall package for a higher tier. |
| **T1** | 10-16 | 1-7 | Fragile everywhere except possibly Agility or Ferocity. Even high individual stats can't compensate for tiny bodies. |

These are guidelines, not hard caps. A T5 dragon with a stat total of 31 (Vhagar: 10+3+8+10) and a T5 with 32 (Caraxes: 7+9+10+6) are both valid. The stat *distribution* matters more than the total — it defines the dragon's combat identity.

### Derived Values

| Derived Stat | Formula | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Dragon HP** | (Might + Resilience) × Tier × 5 | Total damage a dragon can sustain before death. Tier is the primary HP driver — it determines how much punishment a body can take. |
| **Strike** | Might + Ferocity | Offensive dice pool in aerial combat — how hard and how relentlessly the dragon attacks. |
| **Evasion** | Agility + (Resilience / 2), rounded down | Defensive dice pool in aerial combat — dodging, absorbing, surviving. |
| **Terror** | (Tier × 2) + (Ferocity / 2), rounded down | Morale impact on enemy armies. Tier-weighted because size and reputation terrify more than aggression alone — but a savage dragon terrifies more than a docile one. |
| **Critical Strike %** | Agility × 1% | Chance per unblocked hit to inflict Bleeding (1 stack, max 3). Each Bleeding stack deals 3 damage/tick. |

### HP Ranges by Tier

| Tier | HP Range | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **T5** | 300-500 | Vhagar 500, Caraxes 325, Vermithor 450 |
| **T4** | 200-300 | Dreamfyre 300, Silverwing 300, Sunfyre 240 |
| **T3** | 150-210 | Seasmoke 150, Sheepstealer 150, Grey Ghost 150 |
| **T2** | 60-120 | Tessarion 80, Syrax 120 |
| **T1** | 20-50 | Arrax 20, Stormcloud 20 |

The HP gap between tiers is the primary expression of the "difficult but possible" philosophy. A T3 dragon has to chew through 325-500 HP to kill a T5, while the T5 only needs to burn through 150-210. The fight is not impossible — but the math is brutal. T4 dragons (200-300 HP) sit in a middle ground — they can survive longer against T5s but still face steep odds.

### What the Stats Mean

**Might 10** — Vhagar. Jaws that can swallow a horse whole. Fire that melts stone. The raw destructive force of a living siege engine.

**Might 2** — Arrax. Young, small, still growing. His fire can burn a man but not a formation. His jaws can wound but not kill a dragon.

**Agility 10** — Meleys. The Red Queen is untouchable in the air — the swiftest dragon alive. Her speed feeds both her Evasion (13, highest of any dragon) and her 10% critical strike rate. Every tenth blow opens a wound that doesn't close.

**Agility 9** — Caraxes. The Blood Wyrm is serpentine, built for aerial combat, able to twist and strike where slower dragons cannot follow. He moves like a snake with wings — and his 9% critical strike chance means those wounds bleed.

**Agility 3** — Vhagar. Massive and powerful, but she turns like a galleon. Smaller dragons can outmaneuver her — if they survive the first pass. Her 3% crit rate means she rarely inflicts bleeding; she kills with raw force.

**Ferocity 10** — Caraxes. Will not stop fighting. Will not retreat. Will latch onto an enemy dragon's throat and ride it into the ground if that's what it takes to win. The Cannibal shares this score — pure killing instinct.

**Ferocity 3** — Syrax. Pampered, lazy, never tested in real combat. When the Dragonpit mob came, she didn't know how to fight them.

**Resilience 10** — Vhagar. Scales like castle walls. Conventional weapons bounce off her. Only another dragon can truly threaten her.

**Resilience 2** — Arrax. Young scales, still thin. A well-placed scorpion bolt could bring him down. Even massed archery is a danger.

## 5. Dragon Combat — Aerial (1v1)

### When Dragons Fight

Dragon-vs-dragon combat is the most dramatic and consequential event in the game. It is rare, terrifying, and almost always lethal for at least one dragon. The Dance of the Dragons proved that even the victor rarely walks away unscathed.

### The Aerial Combat System

Dragon 1v1 combat uses a **tick-based system** that mirrors the Warfare Foundation's army combat but with dragon-specific mechanics. Each tick represents a pass, clash, or exchange in the aerial duel. Combat uses **d6 dice pools**, consistent with the Warfare Foundation's d6 convention.

### Rider Combat Bonus

A skilled rider doesn't just hang on — they direct the dragon, time strikes, call evasive maneuvers, and exploit openings the dragon alone wouldn't see. The rider's aptitudes provide bonus dice in aerial combat:

**Offensive Bonus**: floor(**max(Prowess, Command)** / 2) bonus dice added to the dragon's **Strike** pool.

**Defensive Bonus**: floor(**max(Cunning, Fortitude)** / 2) bonus dice added to the dragon's **Evasion** pool.

The system uses the **higher** of two aptitudes for each role, allowing different character archetypes to ride effectively:
- A **warrior** (Prowess 9) directs the dragon with combat instinct — striking where the enemy is weakest.
- A **commander** (Command 9) reads the battlefield and coordinates attack runs with tactical precision.
- A **tactician** (Cunning 8) anticipates enemy moves and calls evasive maneuvers before the attack comes.
- A **survivor** (Fortitude 8) holds the saddle through punishment that would throw a lesser rider, keeping the dragon steady under fire.

| Aptitude Value | Bonus Dice |
|---|---|
| 1-2 | +0 |
| 3-4 | +1 |
| 5-6 | +2 |
| 7-8 | +3 |
| 9 | +4 |
| 10 | +5 |

*Example: Daemon Targaryen (Prowess 9, Command 7, Cunning 7, Fortitude 6) rides Caraxes.*
- Offense: max(9, 7) = 9 → +4 Strike dice. Caraxes: 17 + 4 = **21 Strike**.
- Defense: max(7, 6) = 7 → +3 Evasion dice. Caraxes: 12 + 3 = **15 Evasion**.
- Daemon doesn't just ride Caraxes — he *is* Caraxes in combat. The dragon is the weapon; Daemon is the will behind it.

*Example: Aemond Targaryen (Prowess 7, Command 5, Cunning 8, Fortitude 6) rides Vhagar.*
- Offense: max(7, 5) = 7 → +3 Strike dice. Vhagar: 18 + 3 = **21 Strike**.
- Defense: max(8, 6) = 8 → +4 Evasion dice. Vhagar: 8 + 4 = **12 Evasion**.
- Aemond's cunning compensates for Vhagar's sluggishness. He can't make her agile, but he can read the fight.

**Riderless dragons** receive no bonus. Unbonded dragons fighting (The Cannibal, wild dragons) rely solely on their own stats. This is a meaningful disadvantage — it's one of the reasons bonding matters.

### Per-Tick Resolution

**1. Initiative — Who Strikes First**

The dragon with higher **Agility** acts first each tick. Ties are broken by **Ferocity** (the more aggressive dragon doesn't hesitate).

Initiative matters because the first striker can deal damage before the opponent responds — and if that damage pushes the defender into a wound threshold, the defender attacks with reduced dice.

**2. Attack — Strike Roll**

The attacking dragon rolls a number of **d6s** equal to its **Strike** value (Might + Ferocity).

Each die that rolls **4 or higher** is a **hit**.

*Example: Caraxes (Strike 17: Might 7 + Ferocity 10) rolls 17d6. Each 4+ is a hit.*

**3. Defense — Evasion Roll**

The defending dragon rolls a number of **d6s** equal to its **Evasion** value (Agility + Resilience / 2, rounded down).

Each die that rolls **4 or higher** **negates one hit**.

*Example: Vhagar (Evasion 8: Agility 3 + Resilience 10/2) rolls 8d6. Each 4+ cancels a Caraxes hit.*

**4. Damage — Remaining Hits**

Each unblocked hit deals damage equal to **Tier + 3**.

| Attacker Tier | Damage per Hit |
|---|---|
| T5 | 8 |
| T4 | 7 |
| T3 | 6 |
| T2 | 5 |
| T1 | 4 |

This means higher-tier dragons hit harder per connection, not just more often. A T5 claw rakes deeper, bites harder, and breathes hotter.

**5. Critical Strike — Bleeding**

Each unblocked hit has a chance to be a **critical strike**. The chance equals the attacker's **Agility** — 1% per point.

| Agility | Critical Strike Chance |
|---|---|
| 1 | 1% |
| 3 | 3% |
| 5 | 5% |
| 7 | 7% |
| 10 | 10% |

A critical strike deals normal damage AND inflicts **1 stack of Bleeding** on the target.

**Bleeding** is a damage-over-time effect:
- Each stack deals **3 damage per tick** (applied at the start of each tick, before attacks).
- Bleeding stacks up to a **maximum of 3 stacks** (9 damage per tick at full stacks).
- Bleeding persists for the rest of the fight. It cannot be removed.
- Each critical strike adds 1 stack, up to the cap of 3.

*Why this matters:* High-Agility dragons like Meleys (10%), Caraxes (9%), and Sheepstealer (8%) have a meaningful edge in sustained fights. They don't just dodge better — they *wound* better, opening cuts that bleed and bleed. A slow dragon like Vhagar (3% crit) rarely inflicts bleeding; she kills with raw power, not precision. But Caraxes? Every tenth hit rakes something vital, and the Blood Wyrm didn't earn his name by accident.

*Example: Meleys (Agility 10) lands 3 unblocked hits on Vermithor in a tick. Each hit has a 10% chance to crit. Over a 15-tick fight where Meleys lands ~40 total unblocked hits, she averages ~4 critical strikes — easily hitting the 3-stack cap. That's 9 damage/tick for the remaining ticks on top of normal combat damage. Against Vermithor's 450 HP, that's an extra 60-90 damage over the course of the fight.*

**6. Both Dragons Attack**

After the first striker resolves, the second dragon attacks using the same process. Both dragons fight every tick — initiative determines who lands blows first, not who fights.

### Combat Example — Vhagar vs. Caraxes (Equal Riders)

*All matchup data in this document assumes equally skilled riders on every dragon (Prowess 6, Command 6, Cunning 6, Fortitude 6 → +3 Strike, +3 Evasion). This isolates pure dragon-vs-dragon performance from rider variance.*

**Effective Stats:**
- Caraxes: Strike **20** (17 + 3), Evasion **15** (12 + 3), HP 325, Crit 9%
- Vhagar: Strike **21** (18 + 3), Evasion **11** (8 + 3), HP 500, Crit 3%

**Tick 1 — Healthy**

Caraxes has Agility 9, Vhagar has Agility 3. Caraxes strikes first.

*Caraxes attacks:*
- Strike 20 → rolls 20d6, ~10 hits (50% rate)
- Vhagar Evasion 11 → rolls 11d6, ~5.5 blocks
- Net ~4.5 hits × 8 damage (T5) = **~36 damage** to Vhagar (500 HP → ~464)
- Each unblocked hit has 9% crit chance — ~0.4 crits expected this tick

*Vhagar attacks:*
- Strike 21 → rolls 21d6, ~10.5 hits
- Caraxes Evasion 15 → rolls 15d6, ~7.5 blocks
- Net ~3 hits × 8 damage (T5) = **~24 damage** to Caraxes (325 HP → ~301)
- Each unblocked hit has 3% crit chance — ~0.1 crits expected

Both are still Healthy. Despite near-equal Strike pools (21 vs 20), Caraxes deals more net damage because his Evasion (15) blocks more of Vhagar's hits than Vhagar's Evasion (11) blocks of his. Agility is the differentiator.

**Projected outcome:** Simulations show Caraxes wins **59% of the time** with equal riders. Average fight length is 11 ticks. Vhagar's massive HP pool (500 vs 325) partially compensates for the Evasion gap. In lore, Daemon's superior Prowess would widen this further — rider skill is the variable that turns a close fight into a decisive one.

### Wound Thresholds

As a dragon takes damage, it crosses wound thresholds that degrade performance:

| HP Remaining | Condition | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **75%+** | Healthy | No penalties |
| **50-74%** | Wounded | -2 dice from Strike and Evasion pools |
| **25-49%** | Grievously Wounded | -4 dice from Strike and Evasion pools. Dragon may attempt to flee. |
| **1-24%** | Dying | -6 dice from Strike and Evasion pools. Flight is instinctive. |
| **0** | Dead | The dragon falls from the sky. |

The wound spiral is intentional. It creates a death spiral where the losing dragon becomes progressively less capable — but the wound penalties apply to both Strike AND Evasion, meaning a wounded dragon also becomes easier to hit. Fights accelerate toward their conclusion.

### Ferocity — The Will to Keep Fighting

When a dragon's HP drops below 50%, Ferocity determines whether it keeps fighting or tries to flee:

- At **Grievously Wounded** (25-49%), the dragon attempts to disengage. The rider can override this — but only if the dragon's Ferocity is **5 or higher**. A Ferocity 3 dragon will flee regardless of what the rider wants.
- At **Dying** (1-24%), only a dragon with Ferocity **8 or higher** will keep fighting willingly. Anything less tries to escape or crash-lands.
- **Ferocity 10** — will fight to the death. Caraxes and Vhagar at the God's Eye. No retreat, no surrender.

### Disengagement

A dragon can attempt to break off from aerial combat:

- Roll **Agility** d6s. Each 4+ is a success.
- The pursuing dragon rolls **Agility** d6s. Each 4+ is a success.
- If the fleeing dragon has **more successes**, it escapes.
- If the pursuing dragon matches or exceeds, combat continues.
- A dragon **cannot disengage if its Agility is reduced to 0** by wound penalties (too wounded to fly).

A faster dragon can almost always flee a slower one. Arrax could have escaped Vhagar — if the storm hadn't been a factor, and if Arrax hadn't snapped first.

### Rider Survival

When a dragon is killed or crash-lands, the rider makes a single survival check to determine their fate.

**Survival Roll:** Roll **1d20 + Dragon Bonus + Rider Bonus** against **DC 15**.

- **Dragon Bonus:** Higher of the dragon's **Agility** or **Resilience** (divided by 2, rounded down). A nimble dragon might angle the fall; a tough dragon might shield the rider on impact.
- **Rider Bonus:** Highest of the rider's **Fortitude**, **Prowess**, **Cunning**, or **Command** (divided by 2, rounded down). A tough rider endures the impact; a cunning one leaps clear; a commanding one stays calm.

| Result | Outcome |
|---|---|
| **15+** | Rider survives — may be wounded but lives (thrown clear, crash-landed, etc.) |
| **10-14** | Rider is grievously wounded — survives but takes a critical injury |
| **Below 10** | Rider is killed |

*Example: Daemon on Caraxes (Agility 9, Resilience 6). Dragon bonus = floor(9/2) = 4. Daemon's highest aptitude is Prowess 9, rider bonus = floor(9/2) = 4. Total modifier: +8. Daemon needs a 7+ on d20 — 70% survival, 85% to at least live wounded.*

### Simulation Reference — 1v1 Matchups

*All data below generated from Monte Carlo simulation (1,000 fights per matchup, 153 matchups, 153,000 total fights). Every dragon has an equal rider (+3 Strike, +3 Evasion).*

| 15 | Tessarion | T2 | 12 | 12 | 26.9% | 4576-12424 |
| 16 | Stormcloud | T1 | 11 | 10 | 8.8% | 1496-15504 |
| 17 | Arrax | T1 | 9 | 11 | 7.2% | 1228-15772 |
| 18 | Tyraxes | T1 | 8 | 9 | 1.8% | 309-16691 |

**Key takeaway:** With equal riders, The Cannibal takes #1 — his Ferocity 10 + Might 8 give him the highest Strike (21) and he never flees, grinding opponents to death. In lore, the Cannibal is riderless — meaning any player who tames him gains the single most powerful combat dragon in the game. The top 5 T5s are tightly grouped (82-91%), confirming that tier is the primary power determinant, while stat allocation creates meaningful differentiation within tiers.

#### T5 Head-to-Head Matchups

| Matchup | Win Rate | Avg Ticks | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Caraxes vs Vhagar** | Caraxes 59% | 11 | Near-equal Strike (20 vs 21), but Evasion 15 vs 11 is decisive. In lore, Daemon's superior Prowess would widen this further. |
| **Meleys vs Vhagar** | Meleys 55% | 12 | Meleys' Evasion 16 is the highest in the game, but Vhagar's 500 HP is brutal to chew through. Rook's Rest validates this. |
| **Caraxes vs Meleys** | Caraxes 54% | 13 | Ferocity 10 vs Ferocity 8. Caraxes never flees; his aggression grinds through Meleys' superior Evasion. |
| **Cannibal vs Vhagar** | Cannibal 65% | 10 | The Cannibal's Strike 21 + Evasion 13 + Ferocity 10 overwhelms Vhagar's low Agility. Taming the Cannibal is game-changing. |
| **Cannibal vs Caraxes** | Caraxes 53% | 10 | The closest T5 fight. Both have Ferocity 10 — neither flees. Caraxes' Evasion 15 vs Cannibal's 13 is the slim margin. |
| **Cannibal vs Vermithor** | Cannibal 86% | 10 | The Cannibal's superior Ferocity (10 vs 7) and Strike (21 vs 19) dominate. Vermithor's HP (450) isn't enough. |

#### Cross-Tier Win Rate Matrix

How often does each tier beat each other tier (averaged across all dragons in that tier):

|  | vs T1 | vs T2 | vs T3 | vs T4 | vs T5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T5** | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 50% |
| **T4** | 100% | 100% | 82% | 50% | 0% |
| **T3** | 100% | 90% | 50% | 18% | 0% |
| **T2** | 100% | 50% | 10% | 0% | 0% |
| **T1** | 50% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

The "difficult but possible" philosophy is confirmed:
- **Same tier** fights are roughly 50-50 (with rider quality as the tiebreaker).
- **One tier down** is an uphill fight but not impossible (T3 vs T4: 18% win rate).
- **Two tiers down** is near-impossible (T2 vs T4: 0%, T2 vs T3: 10%).
- **T5 vs anything below T4** is a guaranteed kill. Vhagar does not lose to Tessarion. Period.

#### 2v2 Simulation — Vhagar + Cannibal vs Caraxes + Meleys

*1,000 simulations, equal riders on all four dragons. Per-dragon targeting: Vhagar→Meleys, Cannibal→Caraxes, Meleys→Vhagar, Caraxes→Cannibal.*

| Team | Win Rate |
|---|---|
| **Caraxes + Meleys** | **53.3%** |
| Vhagar + Cannibal | 45.9% |

| Dragon | Death Rate | Survives | Avg HP if alive |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vhagar | 61.7% | 38.3% | 198 (40%) |
| The Cannibal | 60.8% | 39.2% | 153 (38%) |
| Caraxes | 58.8% | 41.2% | 148 (46%) |
| Meleys | 52.4% | 47.6% | 148 (42%) |

Most common outcomes: **Both Caraxes + Meleys standing** (35.5%), **both Vhagar + Cannibal standing** (31.6%), then solo survivors. Average fight length: 13.4 ticks.

**Why it matters:** With equal riders, this is a close fight (53% vs 46%) driven by Agility advantages. Caraxes and Meleys have the two highest Agility scores among T5 dragons (9 and 10), giving them first strike and superior Evasion. But Vhagar + Cannibal have more raw HP (900 vs 675), making this competitive. **Rider skill is the variable that turns a coin-flip into a blowout** — give Daemon and Rhaenys their actual stats and Team B wins 90%+.

## 6. Dragon Combat — Battlefield (WBS)

### Dragons in Army Battles

When a dragon joins a Warfare Foundation battle, it does not replace the army — it **amplifies** it. The dragon operates as a special element alongside the army's normal tick-based combat.

Dragons do not require manual commands each tick. Instead, the player configures a **Dragon Behavior** system — a priority-ordered list of conditional rules that the dragon evaluates automatically every tick. The dragon executes the first rule whose condition is met. This is the player's strategic contribution: deciding how their dragon should react to every scenario *before* the battle begins.

---

### The Gambit System

Inspired by Final Fantasy XII's Gambit system. Each dragon has a **behavior loadout** — an ordered list of rules evaluated top-to-bottom every tick. The first rule whose condition is satisfied determines the dragon's action that tick.

> **Warlord Gambits:** This gambit model is also used for Warlord army decisions (Fight/Retreat/Surrender). See `warfare-foundation.md` §14.2. Warlord gambits evaluate at step 0 (before dragon gambits at step 1). If the Warlord orders Retreat or Surrender, dragon gambits are skipped and the dragon auto-withdraws.

```
PRIORITY   CONDITION                              ACTION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1        If own HP below 25%                  → Withdraw
  2        If enemy dragons include "Vhagar"    → Engage Vhagar
  3        If enemy dragons > 0                 → Engage lowest HP%
  4        Always                               → Strafe
```

Players can create **as many rules as they want**, ordered from highest to lowest priority. The system evaluates from the top — the first matching condition fires, and the rest are skipped.

If no rule matches (misconfigured loadout), the dragon defaults to **Strafe** if unengaged, or **Attack engaged dragon** if engaged.

### Logical Operators

Conditions can be combined using logical operators to create compound rules:

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **IF** | Single condition (default) | `IF enemy dragons = none → Strafe` |
| **AND** | Both conditions must be true | `IF enemy dragons > 0 AND own HP above 50% → Engage lowest HP%` |
| **OR** | Either condition can be true | `IF enemy dragons include "Vhagar" OR enemy dragons include "Vermithor" → Withdraw` |
| **NOT** | Inverts a condition | `IF NOT engaged → Strafe` |

Operators can be chained for complex rules:

```
IF enemy dragons include tier T5 AND own HP above 75% AND allied dragons > 0 → Engage highest tier
IF (enemy dragons include "Caraxes" OR enemy dragons include "Meleys") AND own HP above 50% → Engage lowest HP%
IF enemy army morale below 3 AND NOT engaged → Strafe
```

There is no limit to how many operators a single rule can use. Parentheses group sub-expressions where needed. The UI presents these as a visual builder — players don't write raw text, they select conditions from dropdowns and chain them with operator buttons.

---

### Actions

There are four actions a gambit rule can trigger:

| Action | Effect | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **Strafe** | Fire pass over enemy formations. Deals **(Tier × 500) + (Might × 100)** fire damage to the enemy army's HP. Applies **-2 morale** drain and **-Terror** morale drain to the enemy army this tick. | Exposed to scorpion fire. |
| **Intercept [target]** | Challenge an enemy dragon to single combat. Both dragons are **removed from the battlefield** and fight a full aerial duel (see Section 5) that resolves independently. Neither dragon takes WBS damage or contributes to the army until the duel ends. The duel uses its own **Duel Behavior** gambit loadout. | Full aerial combat risk. Dragon lost to army support for duration of duel. |
| **Disengage** | Attempt to break away from the dragon currently engaged with you. Requires an **Agility** roll vs the engaged dragon's Agility. **Triggers an Attack of Opportunity** from the engaged dragon. | AoO damage + possible death. |
| **Withdraw** | Leave the battlefield entirely. Only works if the dragon is **not engaged** in a duel. If in a duel, the dragon must Disengage first (which the duel gambit system handles — see Duel Behavior below). | None if unengaged. AoO risk if in duel. |

**Strafe consolidates the old Strafe + Terror Pass.** There is no reason to fly low and not breathe fire. A strafing dragon deals fire damage *and* terror simultaneously. The Terror value represents the psychological impact of dragonfire, not a separate flyby.

**Guard is removed.** A dragon's morale contribution is passive — being present is enough. There is no defensive "circling" posture. You are either burning the enemy, fighting their dragon, or leaving.

---

### Conditions

Conditions are the "if" side of each gambit rule. Players combine these to create sophisticated behavior:

#### Self Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
| **Own HP above/below X%** | Check the dragon's current HP percentage |
| **Own wound state is [state]** | Healthy (75%+), Wounded (50-74%), Grievous (25-49%), Dying (1-24%) |
| **Own bleed stacks = / > / < N** | Check current bleed stack count |
| **In duel** | True if currently in a dragon duel (only relevant for edge cases — dueling dragons use their Duel Behavior loadout) |

#### Enemy Dragon Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
| **Enemy dragons = none** | No enemy dragons on the battlefield |
| **Enemy dragons = / > / < N** | Count of active enemy dragons |
| **Enemy dragons include [name]** | A specific dragon is present |
| **Enemy dragons include tier [T1-T5]** | At least one enemy dragon of a specific tier is present |
| **Enemy dragons all below tier [X]** | Every enemy dragon is below the specified tier |

#### Allied Dragon Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
| **Allied dragons = / > / < N** | Count of active allied dragons |
| **[Name] alive** | A specific allied dragon is still on the field |
| **[Name] dead or fled** | A specific allied dragon has been killed or withdrawn |
| **No allied dragons remaining** | You are the last dragon on your side |

#### Army Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
| **Enemy army morale above/below X** | Check the enemy army's current morale |
| **Friendly army morale above/below X** | Check your own army's current morale |
| **Enemy army HP above/below X%** | Check the enemy army's remaining HP |
| **Friendly army HP above/below X%** | Check your own army's remaining HP |

#### Universal

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
| **Always** | Always true. Used as the final fallback rule. |

---

### Target Selectors

When a gambit rule uses the **Intercept** action, it needs a target. Available selectors:

| Selector | Description |
|---|---|
| **[Dragon name]** | Intercept a specific dragon by name (e.g., "Intercept Vhagar") |
| **Lowest HP%** | Intercept the enemy dragon with the lowest current HP percentage |
| **Highest tier** | Intercept the strongest enemy dragon |
| **Lowest tier** | Intercept the weakest enemy dragon |

If the specified target is not available (dead, fled, in a duel, or not present), the rule is skipped and evaluation continues to the next gambit.

---

### Intercept — The Dragon Duel

When a dragon uses **Intercept** against an enemy dragon, both dragons are **removed from the battlefield** and enter a separate **single combat duel** that resolves independently from the army battle.

**What happens during a duel:**

- Both dragons fight using the aerial combat system (Section 5) — Strike vs Evasion rolls, wound penalties, crits, and bleed.
- **The duel runs on its own tick cycle**, separate from the WBS army ticks. A duel may resolve in fewer or more ticks than the army battle takes.
- **Neither dragon takes WBS damage** (army attacks, scorpions) while in the duel. They are in the sky above the battlefield, beyond the army's reach.
- **Neither dragon contributes to the army** while dueling. No strafe damage, no morale drain, no terror. The army fights without dragon support.
- **The duel ends** when one dragon dies, flees, or successfully disengages.
- **The surviving dragon returns** to the battlefield on the next WBS tick after the duel ends, resuming its WBS gambit loadout. Its HP, bleed, and wound state carry over from the duel.

**Duel Behavior — A Second Gambit Loadout:**

Each dragon has **two** gambit loadouts:

1. **Battlefield Behavior** — used during WBS ticks (Strafe, Intercept, Withdraw decisions)
2. **Duel Behavior** — used during aerial combat once a duel begins

The Duel Behavior loadout uses the same condition/action/operator system, but with **duel-specific actions**:

| Action | Effect | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **Attack** | Strike the enemy dragon (normal aerial combat roll). | Standard combat risk. |
| **Disengage** | Attempt to break away. Agility roll vs pursuer's Agility. **Triggers Attack of Opportunity.** | AoO damage + possible death. |

Duel conditions focus on the immediate fight:

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
| **Own HP above/below X%** | Check your own HP in the duel |
| **Own wound state is [state]** | Healthy, Wounded, Grievous, Dying |
| **Own bleed stacks = / > / < N** | Current bleed count |
| **Enemy HP above/below X%** | Check the enemy dragon's HP |
| **Enemy wound state is [state]** | Enemy's wound condition |
| **Enemy is [name]** | True if fighting a specific dragon |
| **Enemy tier = / > / < [T1-T5]** | Check the enemy's tier |
| **Always** | Default fallback |

**Example Duel Behavior — Aemond on Vhagar:**

| # | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Always | Attack |

Vhagar doesn't run. One rule. Pure violence.

**Example Duel Behavior — Helaena on Dreamfyre:**

| # | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | If own HP below 40% | Disengage |
| 2 | If enemy tier > T3 AND own HP below 60% | Disengage |
| 3 | Always | Attack |

Dreamfyre fights, but Helaena will try to break off if the fight turns bad — especially against a higher-tier dragon.

**Disengagement in duels:**

- **Triggers an Attack of Opportunity** — the pursuing dragon gets a free attack before the disengage roll.
- **Disengage roll:** The fleeing dragon rolls **Agility** d6s (4+ success) vs the pursuer's **Agility** d6s. More successes = escape. Wound penalties apply.
- **Success:** The dragon escapes the duel and returns to the battlefield next WBS tick, resuming its Battlefield Behavior. It can Strafe, Intercept a different dragon, or Withdraw.
- **Failure:** The dragon remains in the duel and takes its normal combat turn.

Intercepting a dragon is a **commitment**. The army loses dragon support for the duration of the duel, and leaving the duel costs an AoO and a tick. Choose your fights carefully.

---

### Example Battlefield Behavior Loadouts

**Daemon on Caraxes — "Kill the biggest threat, then burn the rest"**

| # | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | If own HP below 10% | Withdraw |
| 2 | If enemy dragons include "Vhagar" | Intercept Vhagar |
| 3 | If enemy dragons > 0 | Intercept highest tier |
| 4 | Always | Strafe |

Daemon will never flee unless near death (Caraxes has Ferocity 10 — he doesn't want to leave). He prioritizes Vhagar above all else. If Vhagar isn't present, he hunts the next biggest threat. If no enemy dragons remain, he burns the army.

**Helaena on Dreamfyre — "Support the army, avoid apex dragons"**

| # | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | If own HP below 25% | Withdraw |
| 2 | If enemy dragons include tier T5 | Withdraw |
| 3 | If enemy dragons = none | Strafe |
| 4 | If enemy dragons > 0 AND enemy dragons all below tier T4 | Intercept lowest HP% |
| 5 | Always | Withdraw |

Helaena is not a warrior. Dreamfyre will strafe if the skies are clear, and pick off weak dragons if no apex threats exist. But she flees from T5 dragons entirely. Her Duel Behavior (shown above) handles the escape logic if she gets into a fight she can't win.

**The Cannibal (staff-controlled, wild) — "Pure aggression"**

| # | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | If enemy dragons > 0 | Intercept highest tier |
| 2 | Always | Strafe |

No self-preservation. No tactics. Attack the strongest thing in the sky, or burn everything below. The Cannibal doesn't flee.

**Aemond on Vhagar — "Break their army unless challenged"**

| # | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | If enemy dragons include "Caraxes" OR enemy dragons include "Meleys" | Intercept lowest HP% |
| 2 | If enemy dragons > 0 AND enemy dragons all below tier T3 | Strafe |
| 3 | If enemy dragons > 0 AND own HP above 75% | Intercept highest tier |
| 4 | Always | Strafe |

Aemond's default is to burn the army — Vhagar's strafe damage is devastating. Rule 1 uses OR to hunt either Caraxes or Meleys if present (targeting whichever is weaker). Rule 2 uses AND — he only ignores lesser dragons if they're *all* below T3. Rule 3 means he'll still intercept mid-tier dragons if he's healthy.

**Rhaenys on Meleys — "Aggressive counter-puncher"**

| # | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | If own HP below 20% | Withdraw |
| 2 | If (enemy dragons include "Vhagar" OR enemy dragons include "Vermithor") AND allied dragons > 0 | Intercept highest tier |
| 3 | If enemy dragons include tier T5 AND allied dragons = 0 AND own HP below 50% | Withdraw |
| 4 | If enemy dragons > 0 | Intercept lowest HP% |
| 5 | Always | Strafe |

Rhaenys is bold but not reckless. Rule 2 shows a complex compound condition — she'll intercept Vhagar or Vermithor, but only if she has allied dragons backing her up. Rule 3 chains three conditions with AND: she retreats from an apex dragon only if she's alone *and* wounded. Otherwise she fights.

---

### Fire Damage in WBS

Dragon fire damage from **Strafe** is applied **in addition to** normal army damage each tick.

- **Strafe damage**: (Tier × 500) + (Might × 100), applied directly to enemy army HP
- Fire damage **ignores** the Marshal's damage reduction (you cannot block dragonfire with shield walls)
- Fire damage **does** interact with fort-level bonuses if the army is defending behind walls

**Strafe Damage by Tier:**

| Dragon | Tier | Might | Strafe Damage | vs. Size 1 Army (102k HP) | vs. Size 3 Army (152k HP) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Vhagar** | T5 | 10 | 3,500 | 3.4% per tick | 2.3% per tick |
| **Caraxes** | T5 | 7 | 3,200 | 3.1% per tick | 2.1% per tick |
| **Vermithor** | T5 | 9 | 3,400 | 3.3% per tick | 2.2% per tick |
| **Dreamfyre** | T4 | 7 | 2,700 | 2.6% per tick | 1.8% per tick |
| **Sunfyre** | T4 | 6 | 2,600 | 2.5% per tick | 1.7% per tick |
| **Tessarion** | T2 | 4 | 1,400 | 1.4% per tick | 0.9% per tick |
| **Arrax** | T1 | 2 | 700 | 0.7% per tick | 0.5% per tick |

Over a 10-tick battle, Vhagar deals ~34% of a Size 1 army's HP in fire alone — devastating, but not war-winning without army support.

### Morale Effects (Integrated with Warfare Foundation)

Dragon morale effects scale with **Tier**:

| Factor | Effect | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Friendly dragon present | **+Tier** starting morale | T5 = +5, T1 = +1 |
| Enemy dragon present | **-Tier** starting morale | T5 = -5, T1 = -1 |
| Dragon strafing | **-2 morale per tick** and **-Terror morale drain** | Terror value applied alongside the standard -2 |
| Friendly dragon arrives mid-battle | **+Tier morale** (one-time) | T5 arrival mid-battle = +5 surge |

**Strafe devastation example:** Vhagar (Terror 15) strafing drains **-2** (active dragon) plus **-15** (Terror value) = **-17 morale in one tick**. An army starting at morale 10 drops to -7 after one pass — but morale is **hard-capped at -20**, so even sustained dragon terror cannot push the rout rate beyond 10% per tick. The army crumbles, but it crumbles at a bounded rate. A War Priest and Herald working together can meaningfully slow this collapse.

**War Priest "Dragon Terror" ability** reduces dragon morale penalties by Faith × 2% per level (already established in Warfare Foundation).

### Anti-Dragon Weapons — Scorpions

When a dragon performs a **Strafe**, it is exposed to anti-dragon fire.

**Scorpion Check:**
- The defending army rolls **1d20** per scorpion battery they have deployed
- The hit threshold depends on the dragon's **Agility**:

| Dragon Agility | Hit on... | Hit Rate |
|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | 10+ | 55% |
| 3-4 | 12+ | 45% |
| 5-6 | 14+ | 35% |
| 7-8 | 16+ | 25% |
| 9-10 | 18+ | 15% |

Even the most agile dragons can be hit — scorpion bolts are fast, and a strafing dragon is committed to its attack run. Agility helps, but nothing makes a dragon immune to ground fire.

**Scorpion Damage:**

Each hit deals **(Tier + 1) × 5 − Resilience** damage (minimum 5).

Damage scales **up** with Tier — a larger dragon is a larger target, and a scorpion bolt sinking into Vhagar's flank hits more mass and does more structural damage than the same bolt glancing off tiny Arrax. Resilience provides modest resistance (thicker scales, denser bone), but the dominant factor is how much dragon the bolt has to tear through.

| Dragon | Tier | Resilience | Dmg/Hit | HP | % HP per Hit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Vhagar** | T5 | 10 | 20 | 500 | 4.0% |
| **Caraxes** | T5 | 6 | 24 | 325 | 7.4% |
| **The Cannibal** | T5 | 8 | 22 | 400 | 5.5% |
| **Vermithor** | T5 | 9 | 21 | 450 | 4.7% |
| **Meleys** | T5 | 7 | 23 | 350 | 6.6% |
| **Dreamfyre** | T4 | 8 | 17 | 300 | 5.7% |
| **Silverwing** | T4 | 8 | 17 | 300 | 5.7% |
| **Sunfyre** | T4 | 6 | 19 | 240 | 7.9% |
| **Seasmoke** | T3 | 5 | 15 | 150 | 10.0% |
| **Tessarion** | T2 | 4 | 11 | 80 | 13.8% |
| **Arrax** | T1 | 2 | 8 | 20 | 40.0% |

The shallow curve means every dragon feels scorpion fire. T5 dragons lose 4-7% HP per bolt — not lethal, but a 20-tick strafing run against a castle garrison accumulates real damage that matters in the next dragon duel. T3 dragons lose 8-10% per bolt and face genuine pressure to withdraw. T1-T2 dragons die in a handful of hits.

**Design intent:** Scorpions are dangerous to **all** dragons. No dragon is immune. The question is how long a dragon can afford to stay in the fire, and whether the accumulated scorpion damage costs them the next fight.

### Tick Resolution Order

Each WBS tick, behavior resolves in this order:

1. **Gambit evaluation** — each dragon on the battlefield evaluates its Battlefield Behavior loadout top-to-bottom, determining its action this tick.
2. **Strafe** — dragons whose gambit selected Strafe deal fire damage and morale drain to the enemy army.
3. **Scorpion checks** — defending armies fire at strafing dragons. Dragons in active duels are not exposed to scorpion fire.
4. **Army combat** — conventional ground forces exchange damage.
5. **Morale & rout** — terror effects, morale shifts, and routing are processed.
6. **Duel resolution** — dragons whose gambit selected Intercept are paired with their targets. Both dragons are removed from the battlefield and enter a new duel instance using their Duel Behavior loadouts. **The duel resolves to completion at the end of the tick** — all duel rounds are fought as a single event within that tick. The surviving dragon returns to the battlefield with its current HP/bleed state and may strafe or withdraw starting next tick.
7. **Withdraw** — dragons whose gambit selected Withdraw (or duel survivors below 30% HP) leave the battlefield entirely.

**Why duels resolve at end-of-tick:** A WBS tick represents a full day of battle. If two dragons duel on day one, the armies below are still fighting that day — the duel doesn't freeze the battlefield. The duel resolves within the same day (tick), but survivors don't return to strafe until the next day. This means initiating a duel costs you a tick of strafing — a meaningful tactical trade-off.

## 7. The Dragons of the Dance

### The Living Dragons

The following dragons are alive at the start of the Dance era. Stats are illustrative — staff finalizes exact values.

---

### T5 — Apex

---

#### The Greens

**Vhagar** — *The Queen of All Dragons*
Rider: Aemond Targaryen

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T5 — Apex** | The largest living dragon by far |
| Size | Ancient (~180 years) | Jaws that swallowed aurochs whole in Balerion's day. Vhagar approaches that scale. |
| Might | **10** | Jaws that can swallow a horse. Fire that melts stone. |
| Agility | **3** | Slow to turn. Massive wingbeats. Fights like a battering ram. |
| Ferocity | **10** | A veteran of Aegon's Conquest. She has killed before and knows how. Will never stop fighting. |
| Resilience | **10** | Scales like castle walls. Nothing short of another dragon threatens her. |
| **HP** | **500** | (10+10) × 5 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **20 + 3 = 23** | Might 10 + Ferocity 10 + Rider (Prowess 7 → +3) |
| **Evasion** | **8 + 4 = 12** | Agility 3 + Resilience 10/2 + Rider (Cunning 8 → +4) |
| **Terror** | **15** | Tier 5×2 + Ferocity 10/2 |
| **Rider** | Aemond | Prowess 7, Command 5, Cunning 8, Fortitude 6 |

Vhagar is the ultimate tank — the highest HP in the game, the highest Might, and functionally immune to scorpion bolts. Her Ferocity 10 means she will never retreat, never disengage — she fights until one of them is dead. Her weakness is Agility 3: she cannot dodge, cannot disengage from faster dragons, and strikes second against almost everyone. She wins by absorbing punishment that would kill any other dragon and hitting back harder.

---

#### The Blacks

**Caraxes** — *The Blood Wyrm*
Rider: Prince Daemon Targaryen

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T5 — Apex** | The deadliest aerial combatant alive |
| Size | Elder (~80 years) | Lean, serpentine, blood-red. Built like a flying snake. |
| Might | **7** | Not the biggest, but powerful jaws and searing fire |
| Agility | **9** | The most maneuverable war dragon alive. Twists like a serpent in the air. |
| Ferocity | **10** | Will not stop. Will not retreat. Will ride you into the lake and die with his teeth in your throat. |
| Resilience | **6** | Lean build means less bulk to absorb hits. His defense is not getting hit. |
| **HP** | **325** | (7+6) × 5 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **17 + 4 = 21** | Might 7 + Ferocity 10 + Rider (Prowess 9 → +4) |
| **Evasion** | **12 + 3 = 15** | Agility 9 + Resilience 6/2 + Rider (Cunning 7 → +3) |
| **Terror** | **15** | Tier 5×2 + Ferocity 10/2 |
| **Rider** | Daemon | Prowess 9, Command 7, Cunning 7, Fortitude 6 |

Caraxes is the opposite of Vhagar — low HP for a T5, but the highest Evasion in the game and Ferocity 10. He wins by dodging what others can't dodge and never, ever stopping. His Terror of 15 is the highest of any dragon, tied with the Cannibal. He is the dragon other dragons fear.

**Meleys** — *The Red Queen*
Rider: Princess Rhaenys Targaryen (The Queen Who Never Was)

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T5 — Apex** | The swiftest war dragon, battle-tested and dangerous |
| Size | Elder (~70 years) | Scarlet scales, copper wings |
| Might | **7** | Powerful for her size |
| Agility | **10** | The swiftest dragon in Westeros — none can match her in the air |
| Ferocity | **8** | A fighter — Rhaenys was no stranger to war |
| Resilience | **7** | Solid, battle-tested |
| **HP** | **350** | (7+7) × 5 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **15 + 4 = 19** | Might 7 + Ferocity 8 + Rider (Command 8 → +4) |
| **Evasion** | **13 + 3 = 16** | Agility 10 + Resilience 7/2 + Rider (Cunning 7/Fortitude 7 → +3) |
| **Terror** | **14** | Tier 5×2 + Ferocity 8/2 |
| **Rider** | Rhaenys | Prowess 5, Command 8, Cunning 7, Fortitude 7 |

Meleys is the swiftest dragon alive — her Agility 10 makes her untouchable in the air, with the highest Evasion (13) of any dragon in the Dance. She compensates for lower Might and Resilience with sheer speed and ferocity. At Rook's Rest, she nearly killed both Sunfyre and Vhagar before being overwhelmed by numbers. That is the mark of a true apex dragon.

---

#### The Unbonded

**Vermithor** — *The Bronze Fury*
Bond Status: Unbonded (last rider: King Jaehaerys I)

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T5 — Apex** | Second largest living dragon. A siege engine with wings. |
| Size | Elder (~100 years) | Bronze scales, tan wings |
| Might | **9** | Enormous. Nearly Vhagar's equal in raw power. |
| Agility | **5** | Large but not sluggish — better than Vhagar in the air |
| Ferocity | **7** | A war dragon, battle-tested, but calmer than Caraxes |
| Resilience | **9** | Thick bronze scales. Nearly impervious. |
| **HP** | **450** | (9+9) × 5 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **16** | Might 9 + Ferocity 7 |
| **Evasion** | **9** | Agility 5 + Resilience 9/2 |
| **Terror** | **13** | Tier 5×2 + Ferocity 7/2 |

Vermithor is the second-most durable dragon alive after Vhagar, and arguably more dangerous in a fight — he trades 50 HP and 1 Might for 2 more Agility and 1 more Evasion. If someone claims him, the balance of the Dance shifts overnight.

---

#### The Wild

**The Cannibal**
Bond Status: Wild (never bonded)

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T5 — Apex** | The oldest wild dragon on Dragonstone. Pure predator. |
| Size | Elder? (unknown age — possibly ancient) | Coal-black, green flame |
| Might | **8** | Massive, fed on other dragons |
| Agility | **6** | Surprisingly agile for his bulk |
| Ferocity | **10** | Eats other dragons. Eats dragon eggs. Pure killing instinct. |
| Resilience | **8** | Scarred, thick-scaled, survived centuries wild |
| **HP** | **400** | (8+8) × 5 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **18** | Might 8 + Ferocity 10 |
| **Evasion** | **10** | Agility 6 + Resilience 8/2 |
| **Terror** | **15** | Tier 5×2 + Ferocity 10/2 |

The Cannibal is arguably the most dangerous dragon in a fight — Strike 18 (tied with Vhagar), Evasion 10, and Ferocity 10 means he hits like Vhagar, dodges better than Vhagar, and will never stop fighting. His weakness is that he has never been ridden and probably never will be. He is a force of nature, not a weapon.

---

### T4 — Formidable

---

#### The Greens

**Dreamfyre** — *The Old She-Dragon*
Rider: Queen Helaena Targaryen

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T4 — Formidable** | Large, powerful Elder — but bonded to a non-combatant rider |
| Size | Elder (~90 years) | Pale blue, silver markings |
| Might | **7** | Large and powerful |
| Agility | **4** | Aging, not built for aerial combat |
| Ferocity | **5** | Not a fighter — Helaena is no warrior, and Dreamfyre reflects her rider |
| Resilience | **8** | Thick old scales |
| **HP** | **300** | (7+8) × 4 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **12 + 1 = 13** | Might 7 + Ferocity 5 + Rider (Prowess 2/Command 2 → +1) |
| **Evasion** | **8 + 1 = 9** | Agility 4 + Resilience 8/2 + Rider (Cunning 3/Fortitude 3 → +1) |
| **Terror** | **10** | Tier 4×2 + Ferocity 5/2 |
| **Rider** | Helaena | Prowess 2, Command 2, Cunning 3, Fortitude 3 |

Dreamfyre has the body of a T5 — she is physically massive and ancient enough. But she has never been pushed, never fought, and her rider has no intention of fighting. She is T4 because her combat *capability* is formidable even if her combat *experience* is nil. In the right hands, she could be devastating. In Helaena's hands, she is a transport.

---

#### The Unbonded

**Silverwing**
Bond Status: Unbonded (last rider: Queen Alysanne)

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T4 — Formidable** | Powerful Elder, gentle by nature |
| Size | Elder (~80 years) | Silver scales, gentle disposition |
| Might | **7** | Powerful enough |
| Agility | **5** | Average |
| Ferocity | **4** | Not a natural fighter. Gentle by dragon standards. |
| Resilience | **8** | Old, thick scales |
| **HP** | **300** | (7+8) × 4 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **11** | Might 7 + Ferocity 4 |
| **Evasion** | **9** | Agility 5 + Resilience 8/2 |
| **Terror** | **10** | Tier 4×2 + Ferocity 4/2 |

Silverwing is Dreamfyre's near-twin statistically — similar size, similar age, similar temperament. Both are T4 because they have the physical power of apex dragons without the killer instinct. Silverwing is the most likely unbonded dragon to accept a new rider, making her strategically invaluable.

---

### T3 — War-Capable

---

#### The Greens

**Sunfyre** — *The Most Beautiful Dragon*
Rider: Aegon II Targaryen

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T4 — Formidable** | Golden scales, a proven war dragon whose tenacity will be tested |
| Size | Adult (~30 years) | Golden scales, flame of gold and pink |
| Might | **6** | Solid but not exceptional |
| Agility | **6** | Average maneuverability |
| Ferocity | **7** | Extraordinary tenacity — will fight through crippling injuries |
| Resilience | **6** | Average toughness, but his will compensates |
| **HP** | **240** | (6+6) × 4 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **13 + 3 = 16** | Might 6 + Ferocity 7 + Rider (Prowess 6 → +3) |
| **Evasion** | **9 + 2 = 11** | Agility 6 + Resilience 6/2 + Rider (Cunning 5/Fortitude 5 → +2) |
| **Terror** | **11** | Tier 4×2 + Ferocity 7/2 |
| **Rider** | Aegon II | Prowess 6, Command 5, Cunning 5, Fortitude 5 |

Sunfyre earns T4 through sheer tenacity. His raw stats are unremarkable for a dragon of his age — but Ferocity 7 reflects the extraordinary determination that lore confirms: crippled at Rook's Rest, dragged across the realm, and he still killed Moondancer in the end. His simulation stats (Strike 16, Evasion 11) already outperformed both other T4 dragons at T3 — the promotion recognizes what the numbers already showed. At T4, he gains 240 HP (up from 180), making him a genuine threat rather than a glass cannon.

---

#### The Blacks

**Seasmoke**
Rider: Ser Laenor Velaryon (later Addam of Hull)

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T3 — War-Capable** | Reliable adult war dragon |
| Size | Adult (~40 years) | Pale silver-grey |
| Might | **5** | Solid, not exceptional |
| Agility | **7** | Quick and responsive |
| Ferocity | **6** | A reliable fighter |
| Resilience | **5** | Average |
| **HP** | **150** | (5+5) × 3 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **11 + 3 = 14** | Might 5 + Ferocity 6 + Rider (Prowess 6 → +3) |
| **Evasion** | **9 + 2 = 11** | Agility 7 + Resilience 5/2 + Rider (Cunning 5 → +2) |
| **Terror** | **9** | Tier 3×2 + Ferocity 6/2 |
| **Rider** | Addam of Hull | Prowess 6, Command 5, Cunning 5, Fortitude 4 |

Seasmoke is the prototypical T3 — a solid, reliable war dragon without any standout traits. His value is consistency and his willingness to accept new riders.

---

#### The Wild

**Sheepstealer**
Bond Status: Wild (never bonded, later claimed by Nettles)

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T3 — War-Capable** | Cunning survivor, not a fighter by choice |
| Size | Adult (~60 years) | Mud brown, ugly, cunning |
| Might | **5** | Not large, not powerful |
| Agility | **8** | Quick, evasive, a survivor |
| Ferocity | **6** | Will fight if cornered but prefers to flee |
| Resilience | **5** | Average |
| **HP** | **150** | (5+5) × 3 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **11** | Might 5 + Ferocity 6 |
| **Evasion** | **10** | Agility 8 + Resilience 5/2 |
| **Terror** | **9** | Tier 3×2 + Ferocity 6/2 |

Sheepstealer's Agility 8 makes him the hardest T3 to hit — his survival strategy is evasion, not endurance. In a straight fight he is average, but he is nearly impossible to catch if he wants to run.

**Grey Ghost**
Bond Status: Wild (never bonded)

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T3 — War-Capable** | The most elusive dragon alive |
| Size | Adult (~50 years) | Pale grey-white, elusive |
| Might | **5** | Average |
| Agility | **9** | The most elusive dragon alive — almost never seen |
| Ferocity | **2** | Avoids all conflict. Flees rather than fights. |
| Resilience | **5** | Average |
| **HP** | **150** | (5+5) × 3 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **7** | Might 5 + Ferocity 2 |
| **Evasion** | **11** | Agility 9 + Resilience 5/2 |
| **Terror** | **7** | Tier 3×2 + Ferocity 2/2 |

Grey Ghost is a paradox — T3 in physical capability, but Ferocity 2 means he will almost never fight. His Evasion 11 is the highest of any non-T5 dragon, making him nearly impossible to catch. He is T3 because of his body, not his will. In the unlikely event he fights, his Strike 7 is abysmal for his tier.

---

### T2 — Blooded

---

#### The Greens

**Tessarion** — *The Blue Queen*
Rider: Prince Daeron Targaryen

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T2 — Blooded** | Young, untested, but promising |
| Size | Adolescent (~15 years) | Cobalt blue scales, copper flame |
| Might | **4** | Young, still growing |
| Agility | **7** | Quick and nimble for her size |
| Ferocity | **5** | Untested in true dragon combat |
| Resilience | **4** | Young scales — vulnerable |
| **HP** | **80** | (4+4) × 2 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **9 + 3 = 12** | Might 4 + Ferocity 5 + Rider (Command 6 → +3) |
| **Evasion** | **9 + 2 = 11** | Agility 7 + Resilience 4/2 + Rider (Fortitude 5 → +2) |
| **Terror** | **6** | Tier 2×2 + Ferocity 5/2 |
| **Rider** | Daeron | Prowess 5, Command 6, Cunning 4, Fortitude 5 |

Tessarion is a T2 with T3 potential. She has good Agility and balanced stats for her age. Growth and combat experience could push her to T3 during the Dance.

---

#### The Blacks

**Syrax** — *The Golden Dragon*
Rider: Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T2 — Blooded** | Physically large but utterly untested in combat |
| Size | Adult (~30 years) | Yellow scales, huge but lazy |
| Might | **6** | Large enough but never pushed |
| Agility | **5** | Sluggish — fed, not exercised |
| Ferocity | **3** | Never tested. Pampered. Does not know how to fight. |
| Resilience | **6** | Adequate bulk, untested scales |
| **HP** | **120** | (6+6) × 2 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **9 + 2 = 11** | Might 6 + Ferocity 3 + Rider (Command 5 → +2) |
| **Evasion** | **8 + 3 = 11** | Agility 5 + Resilience 6/2 + Rider (Cunning 6 → +3) |
| **Terror** | **5** | Tier 2×2 + Ferocity 3/2 |
| **Rider** | Rhaenyra | Prowess 3, Command 5, Cunning 6, Fortitude 4 |

Syrax is the poster child for "combat power, not size." Physically she is an Adult — larger than Tessarion, larger than Vermax. But she has never fought, never hunted, never been pushed. Her Ferocity 3 and Agility 5 reflect a pampered creature that does not know what combat is. She is T2 because she lacks every intangible that makes a dragon dangerous.

**Vermax**
Rider: Prince Jacaerys Velaryon

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T2 — Blooded** | Young, eager, growing into a fighter |
| Size | Adolescent (~16 years) | Young, growing |
| Might | **4** | Not yet fully grown |
| Agility | **7** | Quick and responsive |
| Ferocity | **6** | Willing to fight |
| Resilience | **4** | Young scales |
| **HP** | **80** | (4+4) × 2 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **10 + 3 = 13** | Might 4 + Ferocity 6 + Rider (Prowess 6 → +3) |
| **Evasion** | **9 + 2 = 11** | Agility 7 + Resilience 4/2 + Rider (Cunning 5/Fortitude 5 → +2) |
| **Terror** | **7** | Tier 2×2 + Ferocity 6/2 |
| **Rider** | Jacaerys | Prowess 6, Command 5, Cunning 5, Fortitude 5 |

Vermax is the best pure fighter among the T2 dragons — Ferocity 6 and Strike 10 give him real offensive output for his tier. He and Tessarion are well-matched rivals.

**Moondancer**
Rider: Lady Baela Targaryen

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T2 — Blooded** | Small, fierce, fights above her weight |
| Size | Young (~12 years) | Pale green, slender |
| Might | **3** | Small, still growing |
| Agility | **8** | Extremely nimble — one of the fastest young dragons |
| Ferocity | **7** | Fierce beyond her size. Baela's fire in dragon form. |
| Resilience | **3** | Fragile. Young scales offer little protection. |
| **HP** | **60** | (3+3) × 2 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **10 + 2 = 12** | Might 3 + Ferocity 7 + Rider (Prowess 5 → +2) |
| **Evasion** | **9 + 3 = 12** | Agility 8 + Resilience 3/2 + Rider (Cunning 6 → +3) |
| **Terror** | **7** | Tier 2×2 + Ferocity 7/2 |
| **Rider** | Baela | Prowess 5, Command 4, Cunning 6, Fortitude 5 |

Moondancer is dangerously brave for her size. Agility 8 and Ferocity 7 give her the combat instincts of a much larger dragon, but her Might 3 and Resilience 3 mean she cannot take a hit. Against Sunfyre at the end of the Dance, she was outmatched in every physical dimension — but she fought anyway.

---

### T1 — Fledgling

---

#### The Blacks

**Arrax**
Rider: Prince Lucerys Velaryon

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T1 — Fledgling** | Small, fragile, outmatched by everything |
| Size | Young (~14 years, small for his age) | Notably small |
| Might | **2** | Barely more than a hatchling in combat terms |
| Agility | **7** | Fast for his size — his only advantage |
| Ferocity | **4** | Snapped at Vhagar out of fear, not courage |
| Resilience | **2** | Fragile. One bite from Vhagar ended him. |
| **HP** | **20** | (2+2) × 1 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **6 + 1 = 7** | Might 2 + Ferocity 4 + Rider (Prowess 3/Command 3 → +1) |
| **Evasion** | **8 + 2 = 10** | Agility 7 + Resilience 2/2 + Rider (Cunning 4 → +2) |
| **Terror** | **4** | Tier 1×2 + Ferocity 4/2 |
| **Rider** | Lucerys | Prowess 3, Command 3, Cunning 4, Fortitude 3 |

Arrax is the tragic example of what happens when a T1 faces a T5. His Agility 7 meant he *could* have escaped Vhagar (Agility 3) — the disengagement math favored him heavily. But the storm, and Arrax snapping at Vhagar in fear, sealed his fate. One bite. 20 HP. Dead.

**Tyraxes**
Rider: Prince Joffrey Velaryon

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T1 — Fledgling** | Young, timid, barely rideable |
| Size | Young (~10 years) | Small, dark-scaled |
| Might | **2** | Small and underdeveloped |
| Agility | **5** | Average for a young dragon |
| Ferocity | **3** | Timid. Does not want to fight. |
| Resilience | **2** | Fragile |
| **HP** | **20** | (2+2) × 1 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **5 + 1 = 6** | Might 2 + Ferocity 3 + Rider (Prowess 2/Command 2 → +1) |
| **Evasion** | **7 + 1 = 8** | Agility 5 + Resilience 2/2 + Rider (Cunning 3 → +1) |
| **Terror** | **3** | Tier 1×2 + Ferocity 3/2 |
| **Rider** | Joffrey | Prowess 2, Command 2, Cunning 3, Fortitude 2 |

Tyraxes is the weakest combat dragon on the roster. Low stats across the board and a temperament that makes him unlikely to fight even if commanded. He is a child's dragon — barely more than a pet with wings.

**Stormcloud**
Rider: Prince Aegon (future Aegon III)

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **T1 — Fledgling** | Young, small, but braver than he should be |
| Size | Young (~8 years) | Small, pale |
| Might | **2** | Small |
| Agility | **6** | Decent reflexes |
| Ferocity | **6** | Brave beyond his size. Fought to save his rider despite being badly wounded. |
| Resilience | **2** | Fragile |
| **HP** | **20** | (2+2) × 1 × 5 |
| **Strike** | **8 + 1 = 9** | Might 2 + Ferocity 6 + Rider (Prowess 2/Command 2 → +1) |
| **Evasion** | **7 + 1 = 8** | Agility 6 + Resilience 2/2 + Rider (Cunning 3/Fortitude 3 → +1) |
| **Terror** | **5** | Tier 1×2 + Ferocity 6/2 |
| **Rider** | Aegon III | Prowess 2, Command 2, Cunning 3, Fortitude 3 |

Stormcloud is the best fighter among the T1s — Ferocity 6 and Strike 8 give him genuine offensive capability for his tier. He carried Aegon III across the Gullet through enemy dragonfire, taking mortal wounds and still flying until he reached safety. He died of his wounds. The bravest T1 on the roster.

**Morning**
Bond Status: Not yet hatched at start of Dance

| Stat | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| Tier | **—** | Unhatched. No combat tier assigned. |
| Size | Egg/Hatchling | Will hatch during the Dance if events allow. |
| Notes | | Stats TBD when/if hatched and grown. Likely T1 initially. |

## 8. Open Questions

### Core Design Decisions
- ~~Dragon Binding~~ — **RESOLVED.** See [dragon-bonding.md](dragon-bonding.md) for the complete bonding system (d6 pool check, favored aptitudes, sacrifice mechanics, DC by tier).

- ~~Dragon Death Consequences~~ — **RESOLVED.** When a rider's bonded dragon dies:
  - **Immediate:** Rider makes a survival check if present (see §Rider Survival). If absent (dragon died in battle without rider), no physical check needed.
  - **No mechanical penalty.** The rider suffers no stat penalties or status effects.
  - **Permanent bond loss.** The rider can **never bond another dragon**. The bond between dragon and rider is singular — when it breaks, something in the rider breaks with it. This is a permanent, irreversible consequence.
  - **Narrative:** Staff may RP the rider's grief, but there are no mechanical effects beyond the permanent inability to bond again.

- ~~Dragon Eggs~~ — **RESOLVED.** Dragon eggs exist in play as **narrative items**, not a dragon-production system:
  - Eggs are **staff-placed** — they exist at specific locations (Dragonstone, dragon lairs) as part of world setup
  - Eggs **can hatch** during the campaign, but only through staff-driven narrative events (not player crafting or a timer)
  - Hatched dragons start at **T1** (Fledgling) and are too young to ride or fight for an extended period (staff determines growth pacing)
  - Eggs cannot be bought, sold, or mass-produced — each one is a unique narrative event
  - Morning (Rhaena's egg) is the primary example — it may hatch during the Dance if events allow

- ~~Rider Death~~ — **RESOLVED.** When a bonded rider dies:
  - **In battle:** The dragon immediately attempts to **Withdraw** from the battlefield, regardless of its gambit loadout. If in a duel, it attempts to Disengage first (AoO risk). A Ferocity 8+ dragon may instead enter a **berserk strafe** for 1-2 ticks before withdrawing (attacking both sides indiscriminately).
  - **After battle:** The dragon becomes **unbonded**. Staff assumes temporary NPC control.
  - **Behavior:** Unbonded dragons typically return to their lair (Dragonstone, the Dragonpit, or wherever they were housed). Wild-tempered dragons (Cannibal, Sheepstealer) may flee to the wild entirely.
  - **Re-bonding:** The dragon becomes available for new bonding attempts. The bonding DC depends on the dragon's temperament — a dragon whose rider just died may be more hostile (staff may impose a temporary +2 DC increase for 14 ticks).

### Combat Tuning
- ~~Damage per hit (Tier + 3)~~ — **VALIDATED.** Simulation confirms T5 same-tier fights resolve in 10-14 ticks, accelerating through wound spiral. Pacing feels right.
- ~~Hit threshold (6+ on d6)~~ — **VALIDATED.** 50% hit rate produces ~3-5 net hits per tick at T5, consistent and predictable.
- ~~Wound penalties (-2/-4/-6 dice)~~ — **VALIDATED.** Death spiral kicks in around tick 7-9 for same-tier fights, accelerating the endgame without making it instant.
- ~~Scorpion damage by tier~~ — **RESOLVED.** Scorpion damage formula is (Tier + 1) × 5 − Resilience (§Anti-Dragon Weapons). Naval scorpions get +25% accuracy at sea (naval-warfare.md §6.2). Settlement scorpion batteries target both dragons and siege engines (siege-mechanics.md §3.5.1). The tier-scaled values create meaningful pressure: T5 dragons lose 4-7% HP per bolt (sustainable short-term, dangerous over 20+ ticks), T1-T2 dragons die in a handful of hits. A 100-ship fleet with scorpion batteries at sea (90% hit rate vs Vhagar) can deal devastating damage per tick.
- **Strafe damage formula** — (Tier × 500) + (Might × 100) against 40k-150k army HP pools. Values documented, requires simulation validation against actual army compositions.
- **Rider risk (1d20, nat 1/nat 20)** — documented (§Rider Survival). Requires play-testing to determine if frequency feels right.
- ~~Rider bonus magnitude~~ — **RESOLVED.** Keep **/2** (not /3). The +6 to +8 total dice advantage for well-ridden dragons is intentional — riders should matter significantly. A riderless T5 should be at meaningful disadvantage against a well-ridden T5. The /2 divisor ensures that even a mediocre rider provides +3 to +4 dice, making bonding always worthwhile. A /3 divisor would reduce rider impact to +2 to +3, making rider quality feel irrelevant. The current system creates a clear hierarchy: riderless < weak rider < strong rider.
- **Critical strike balance** — Agility% crit chance is intentional asymmetry. High-Agility dragons (Meleys 10%, Caraxes 9%) are designed as finesse fighters who win long fights through bleed accumulation. Low-Agility dragons (Vhagar 3%) win through raw damage, not crits. Requires play-testing to confirm the feel matches design intent.

### Tier Balance
- ~~T4 population~~ — **RESOLVED.** Sunfyre promoted to T4 (was T3). T4 now has 3 dragons: Dreamfyre, Silverwing, Sunfyre. Sunfyre's raw stats (Strike 13, Evasion 9) already outperformed the other T4s at T3 — the promotion recognizes what the numbers showed. His Ferocity 7 and lore trajectory (Rook's Rest survival, killing Moondancer while crippled) justify the tier. HP: 240 (up from 180).
- ~~Syrax at T2~~ — **VALIDATED.** Syrax at T2 with Rhaenyra's rider bonus (+2/+3) brings her to Strike 11 / Evasion 11, which is competitive with other T2 dragons. The tier system is working: she is physically Adult but a T2 combatant.
- ~~Grey Ghost at T3~~ — **RESOLVED.** Keep at T3. Tier represents physical capability, not willingness to fight. Grey Ghost has a T3 body (150 HP, T3 damage scaling). His Ferocity 2 is already his penalty — he flees constantly and has terrible Strike (7). Downtiering would double-penalize him. If cornered or forced to fight, he hits like a T3. His Evasion 11 (highest non-T5) makes him nearly impossible to catch — that's the point.
- ~~Tier advancement pacing~~ — **RESOLVED.** Advancement is purely staff discretion — no tick timers, no automatic progression. Staff promotes dragons when the narrative warrants it (e.g., Tessarion T2→T3 after first real combat). Promotions should be rare, impactful, and tied to story moments. There is no formula.
- ~~T5 vs T4 matchups~~ — **VALIDATED.** T5 beats T4 100% of the time. This is intentional — there should be no scenario where a T4 threatens a T5 in a straight 1v1. The gap is the point.

### Integration Points (Already Established)
- `is_dragon_seed` flag exists in character applications (Valyrian blood outside Targaryen line)
- Dragonblood referenced in Destiny system as a creation-time spend
- Morale effects integrated with Warfare Foundation (now tier-scaled: +/-Tier instead of flat +/-5)
- War Priest "Dragon Terror" ability: reduces dragon morale penalties by Faith × 2% per level
- Dragon movement speed: 0.01 px/s (fastest unit type, excluded from terrain penalties)

### Warfare Foundation Updates — RESOLVED
- ~~Morale modifiers in warfare-foundation.md reference flat +5/-5 for dragon presence~~ — **DONE.** Updated to +/-Tier.
- ~~Guard action morale bonus~~ — **Guard action was removed.** Dragon morale contribution is passive (presence only). No Guard stance exists.
- ~~Strafe damage formula update~~ — **DONE.** Strafe formula is fully documented here in §4. Warfare-foundation.md now references dragon-system.md for strafe mechanics.
